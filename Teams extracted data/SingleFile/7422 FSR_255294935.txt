06.   OUR OBSERVATIONS & VERIFICATIONS:

6.1   During our visit, it was observed that the petrol pump was in operational condition
      and there was a restaurant (Al plaza) besides the petrol pump which is also a part of
      the petrol pump.

6.2   The subject premise is located at junction of Mumbai-Bangalore highway and road
      going towards one village. There are two common entrances for petrol pump and Al
      plaza, one is at highway and second is at village road.

6.3   During our visit, we verified the nature and extent of loss of contents at Al Plaza. It
      was evident that burglary had occurred at the said location.

6.4   Further, we were informed by insured that the equipment and furniture of the
      restaurant were kept in kitchen area of the restaurant. It was observed that the latch
      of the backside door of the kitchen was in broken condition and further it was noted
      that only one water cooler, one ice cube machine and some fire extinguishers were
      present in the kitchen. On inspection of water cooler and ice cube machine, it was
      noted that the compressors of both the machines were stolen.

6.5   Further, the Insured provided us list of stolen items along with their rates. We have
      verified the rates in market and the same were found to be fair and reasonable.

6.6   In our opinion, the subject incident might have occurred in multiple events as we
      could not observe any recent marks of foot prints or any tyres marks of vehicles. The
      machines stolen by the miscreants are heavy and could not be carried away without
      usage of any vehicle. Also, the subject premise was closed since 2009 and there was
      no security guard deputed at the premises and the loss was observed by pump
      operator when he checked the Al plaza once he heard noise from the plaza.

      DEPRECIATION:

      Since the subject policy is on Reinstatement Value basis, no depreciation will be
      applicable for subject claim.

      POLICY REVIEW:

09.1 Coverage:

      During our visits, we had physically verified the nature & extent of damages
      sustained by the insured. The loss had occurred within the policy period. We did not
      observe any indication to suspect a foul play or operation of any perils specifically
      excluded under the subject policy to have caused the damages. Therefore, the loss
      falls within the ambit of the subject policy.



                                                                                     Cl.

09.2 Adequacy of Sum Insured:


      Since the Burglary cover in the subject policy is on first loss basis, the adequacy has
      not been checked for the subject claim.

09.3 Excess:


      As per the Insurance Policy, applicable Excess is INR 10,000/- for each and every
      claim. As per or observation and looking at size of stolen items, we are of opinion
      that the material could not be stolen in one attempt. In our opinion, the subject
      incident might have occurred in not less than 4 events. Hence, we have deducted
      excess for 4 events in our assessment.

      ASSESSMENT OF LOSS:


      The water cooler and ice cube machine were not stolen from the Al plaza but their
      compressors were missing, hence we have allowed only the cost of compressors (as
      per market rates) instead of whole machines in our assessment.

      Based on our observations and verifications, the loss has been assessed as follows:

                                      Particulars                Amount (Rs.)
                      Amount Claimed                                454,033.95
                      Gross Assessed loss                           421,259.53
                      Less Excess (considering 4 theft events)       40,000.00
                      Net Adjusted Loss                              381,260/-
