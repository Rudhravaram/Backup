3.0    INCIDENT


3.1    During our visit, Mr. Sharad Kumbhar (Partner) conducted us
       around and narrated the incident. It was informed that, on the
       intervening night of 14th & 15th September 2019 @ 3.00 am, there
       was heavy rainfall at Bhiwandi, Thane area due to which various
       surrounding regions were flooded. The insured’s premises were
       also affected. Also the river passing along the side of the
       insured’s factory added more amount of water that entered the
       factory premises. The water was removed prior to our visit,
       however, the water level marks at around 1.5 feet to 2.0 ft inside
       the premises were clearly visible. The flood water entered in the
       insured’s all galas where the stock of yarn received from 15
       parties was stored. This third party stock, Insured’s own stock of
       starch and machineries like rewinding motor, panel were
       submerged into the muddy/contaminated water and got
       damaged.


 3.2   We have reproduced the gist of the narration given by the
       insured. The original narration (in vernacular) given by the insured
       is enclosed with the report.


4.0    CAUSE OF DAMAGE VIS-À-VIS ADMISSIBILITY



4.1    During our inspection the inundation level was clearly visible
       inside the insured’s premises. It was measured at various places.
       The water level inside the premises was around 2 ft. Investigators
       also opined that based on the Metrological Rainfall analysis, the
       rain fall was recorded for 24 hr in bhiwandi ending 8:30 am on 15
       September, 2019 is 150 mm (heavy rain).




14987/ICICI/1920-New Jai Malhar Sizers
4.2    Thus based on our observations, investigation report, information
       provided to us, the cause of loss could reasonably have
       attributed to flood/ inundation.

       running this business since last 10 years at the same place.
       Working of mill:
       Various parties provide the cotton yarn to Insured. In the mill,
       processing is done on the yarn and yarn gets converted into
       beam. Futher Insured returns these beams to the respective
       party. Process flow chart as follows:
       Cotton yarn (raw) → Insured’s Mill for processing → converted
       into beam→ return to respective party.

       and one at the rear side. The premises is well devided into three

       one gala to another internally. Sizing process machinery and
       other machinery units are installed inside of Galas. The thread
       beams were arranged one above the other and are also kept in
       Galas. Apart from galas there are other section such as office

       area, spinning unit,wraping unit etc. Goods packed in sacks and
       arranged in stacks in the front on the office area.


5.3    Our Observations:
       We carried out the survey on 17th September 2019, after the
       water level in the insured premises had receded. The insured is in
       the business of converting beams from cotton yarn through the
       process of wraping & sizing. During inspection of the site the
       water inundation level was measured at various places. The
       water level inside the premises was around 1.5 ft to 2.0 ft. our
       observations are follows:
          •   The yarn packets which were kept inside the galas were
              damaged due to muddy water.
          •   Huge beams of threads arranged one above the other;
              lower beams were almost submerged in water and got
              damaged while the one arranged on top layers were not
              affected.
          •   Machineries like rewinding motor, panel were submerged
              into the muddy/contaminated water and got damaged.
          •   Mud stains were seen on the some yarn packets and
              beam rolls, which render them unfit for its intended use. The
              stock was not fit for use due to the water affected and
              and would not realize any value other than scrap.


5.4    Further detailed segregation of sound stock and damaged stock
       was carried out. During inspection the final quantity of loss was
       ascertained & assessed the loss accordingly. Damaged
       machineries were sent for repair. Detailed extent of damages is

             Insured have claimed loss for third party for Rs. 3089053.65.

             lodged by owner on Insured for damaged stock giving

             Insured. Thus claimed quantity is ascertained. Insured have
             provided purchase bills for damaged items. Rate are
             considered n the basis of the same. Still,we have deducted
             5 % for likely negotiation/Variation in qty/quality/Rate.



  B    Own stock loss

       Insured have preferred claim for Rs. 17500.00 for own stock of
       starch. However, no supporting was provided for the same
       hence not considered by us in our assessment.

       wiring got damaged. Insured have reapired them and have

       deprciation is not applied.


7.3    Salvage

       The damaged items were not fit for the intended use. It was
       decided that salvage team from Insurance company will take
       the salvage and provide quote for it. The salvage was disposed
       by Insured. In fact, water affected yard would not have any
       alternative use and may not realizer any salvage value. Still, we
       have deducted 15% amount on lump sum towards salvage.
       Accordingly, deduction of Rs. 326,495.62 was made in the
