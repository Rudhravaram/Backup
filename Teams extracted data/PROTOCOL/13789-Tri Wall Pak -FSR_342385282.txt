 8.0       METHODOLOGY OF ASSESSMENT OF LOSS


 8.1       The assessment of loss is based on our inspection & documents
           submitted by the Insured. The reinstatement is completed by the
           insured and hence, the loss assessment is based on the invoices. It
           may be noted that during the process of the survey each and every
           item was inspected by us. Various filters/adjustments such as
           usable/unusable, repairable/irreparable were applied to the initial list
           generated by the insured. The final assessment is based on such final
           list   generated            after   due   vetting/verifications.   The     supporting
           documents are enclosed with the report. Following points are crucial
           from assessment point of view.


  ►        Building, FFF
           The building, FFF are not covered under the policy hence assessment
           is not done towards the same.


  ►        Machinery
           As elaborated in our earlier para, the machines were totally burnt
           and these were not fit for its intended purpose. Thus, considered to
           be Total loss. Few machines were imported. Thus, insured have
           imported the same. Insured has lodged the claim of Rs. 87,31,800/-
           towards repair/replacement cost of Plant & Machineries. Insured has
           reinstated the property & provided us the repair/replacement import
           Invoices, bill of entry, port charges, custom charges, transport
           charges & indigenous invoices. The loss is assessed based on such
           repair/replacement Invoices. Where ever tax Invoices, not provided,
           the cost has not been considered.

           It was understood that the cutting machine was under breakdown at
           the time of loss. The supporting letter through insured is placed as
           Enclosure 11. to the report. The insured have provided supporting
           invoices for the repair charges, thus, the repair cost (Rs. 42,721/-) of
           items to be replaced, has been deducted while assessing the loss.
           The other charges were found reasonable, hence considered for the

                     letter dated 16th June 19
                
           To calculate the affected stock as on date of loss we have adopted
           following documents…..
                    Unit Balance sheets 16-17, 17-18 duly certified by their CA–
                     Enclosure 18.

           value. The same is considered as around 11000 kgs @ Rs.25/- i.e. Rs.
           2,75,000/- against insured offer of Rs.1,18,525/-.
