    INCIDENT                          :   During our visit we were attended by Mr.
                                          Nigam     Akhani.     It   was   reported   that
                                          between 14th Jan and 15th Jan 2020 theft
                                          had occurred at insured’s premises. Various
                                          materials such as lightning Arrestor, Copper
                                          Cables were stolen and several materials
                                          was damaged in attempt of the theft. FIR
                                          has been reportedly lodged by Insured.
                                          However, any police documents were not
                                          provided to us.


    NATURE & EXTENT OF DAMAGE         :


    During our visit we were attended by Mr. Nigam Akhani. It was reported that Solar
    plant produces 50 megawatt of energy and distributed to Dahiwadi and Phaltan
    MSEB. We were guided through location of loss and narrated with supposed

    cause. We have then inspected and photographed the loss location thoroughly.
    Our observations were as below.
       1. 3 Lightning Arrestors were damaged and their copper cable has been
          reportedly stolen.
       2. Barbed Wire fencing of 10 meter was found cut.
       3. 17 Solar Panel module were damaged due to reported stone pelting.
       4. Few diode boxes beneath solar panel found burnt/broken. Reportedly, it
          was due to panel wire been cut. We have observed cuts on wire. As
          gathered total 82 modules were damaged in above fashion.


    CLAUSE OF LOSS VS ADMISSIBILITY


    Following aspects are very crucial to determine admissibility of claim:
       1. As per Insured the cause of loss is theft. Unknown person has reportedly
          entered to the plant through teared fences. At the time of our inspection
          fences were found cut from multiple sides. Some Solar panels had stone
          pelted marks with some stone placed on its surface. Beneath, the solar
          panels diode cables were also found cut.
       2. Police complaint was reportedly lodged by Insured. However, no police
          documents were provided to us. The damages were spread over an area
          of around 300 acres. Such damages cannot take place in one incident. We
          had asked insured to share routine checkup reports to ascertain the exact
          circumstances of loss. However, Insured had refused to share the same. Also,
          he had refused to sign our observations made during the survey. Upon
          asking the reason they reverted that they are abide of compliances and
          respective documents will be shared on mails. However, no documents
          were provided to us.
       3. Loss have occurred reportedly between 14th Jan and 15th Jan 2020. Survey
          was requisitioned on 7th February 2020. Reasons for delay in applying for the
          survey was not provided us.
    Hence in absence of police documents and other claim relevant documents,
    exact cause of loss cannot be established.
