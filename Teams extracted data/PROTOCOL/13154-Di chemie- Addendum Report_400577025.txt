                               ADDENDUM REPORT

             ADDENDUM REPORT IN RESPECT OF CLAIM PREFERRED BY

     M/s Dia- Chemie , Dadaji Dhakji Bldg, 2nd floor, 56/58, Garib Das Street,
                    Vadgadi Mandvi HO, Mumbai - 400003

   Further to our survey report of even number 13154/ICICI/17-18 and dated April 13,
                2018, we are issuing clarification on following points…


   1.1     Post our submission of the survey report, Investigator addendum
           report was provided to us. As per the report, fire affected
           godowns are not covered under the Policy. Hence claim
           lodged by the Insured is not admissible.


   1.2     In our earlier main report, it was mentioned in ‘Admissibility’
           section that as per preliminary findings of the investigation
           report, there was mismatch in the godown gala numbers. As per
           the series wise counting, the affected godowns were in E9, E10,
           E11 whereas the policy has mentioned as D2 & 17, 18, 19, 20, 21.
           The final report of the investigator is awaited at the time of
           issuing our report. However, the date of loss, the cause of loss as
         reported, falls within the purview of the policy. The admissibility
         could be decided after the receipt of the investigation report.


1.3      Now, investigator visited the premises again on 14 th February
         2020 and have opined that fire affected godowns and policy
         covered godowns are different. Investigators have concluded
         that godowns covered under Policy were not affected in the
         said fire incidence. Conclusion mentioned in investigation
         addendum report is as follows:
         QUOTE
         In summary, our provided conclusion (refer fire forensic
         investigation report dated : 23-11-2017) as "Insured mentioned
         burnt godowns/ policy covered godown numbers D2-18,D2-19,
         D2-20 found intact at other place in the same complex."
         remained same and the same now confirmed as today also the
         "said burnt godowns were renamed as D4-8,D-4-9 & D4-10."
         Hence the policy covered godowns were not affected in said
         incidence of fire (date of fire:13.07.2017).
         UNQUOTE
         Investigation addendum report is enclosed with this report.
