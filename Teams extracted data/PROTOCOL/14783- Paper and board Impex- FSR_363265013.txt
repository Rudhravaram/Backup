3.0   INCIDENT


3.1   It was well known that Bhiwandi, Kolhapur, Sangli, Pune, Karad and
      adjoining cities in Western Maharashtra were flooded due to incessant
      torrential monsoon rains from 4th August 2019 onwards. Insured’s premises
      was also flooded in the incident. The water reportedly entered inside the
      premises on 4th August 2019 and receded on 6th August 2019. Water level
      at surrounding area of Insured premises was around 3.5 ft and at inside
      the Insured’s godown was around 10 inches due to flooding/inundation.
      So the stock of raw paper reels, stock under process and finished and
      semi-finished stock of paper was damaged due to water.


3.2   It was informed that insured took precautionary measures after the water
      level receded from the premises and stacked the paper reels on the
      pallets. At the time of our inspection, ready paper packages (as per the
      standard sizes) were found in wet condition. Ink marks were found on the
      walls as well as on the reels. CCTV was installed in the premises but due
      to power cut the recording on the date of loss was not available. We
      advised insured to segregate the damaged paper stock separately and
      prepare the list of damaged items for our final verification.


4.0   CAUSE OF DAMAGE


4.1   Heavy rains poured in Maharashtra (Bhiwandi, Kolhapur, Sangli, Karad,
      Ichalkarancji, Pune etc) Kerala & other many states from 26th July 2019 to
      12th August 2019. Due to this flood situation occurred at many places. The
      incidence is well reported in TV and print media all over the countries.
      Due to this, water logged at insured’s named location.


4.2   Thus, based on our observations and information provided to us, the
      cause of loss could reasonably attributed to flood.
