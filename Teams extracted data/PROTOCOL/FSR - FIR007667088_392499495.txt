         Fire, Lightening, Flood, Storm, Inundation, Earthquake etc. In the
         instant case, the damages have taken place due to fire. Thus
         operated peril and loss location are covered under the Policy.
         Policy is effective as on date of loss. Hence claim lodged by Insured
         is admissible.

         ‘reinstatement value’ clauses. Insured have not provided final bills

                Insured have not carried out the reinstatement of the
                damaged property and wish to settle the claim on market
                value basis. The exact age of the equipment is not available.

                capitalization details of the building from year 2016 to 2020.
                Further by considering age of plant, we have calculated the
                additions made in the subsequent period upto the date of loss.
                Based on the details made available to us, we have
                extrapolated the RIV upto the date of loss by applying index
                for escalation in prices. Further by applying adequate
                depreciation,       market     value     was    worked      out       as    Rs.
                2,133,544,778.29.        Sum   insured    availed    for    P     &    M     is
