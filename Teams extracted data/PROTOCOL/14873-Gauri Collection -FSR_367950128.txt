3.0    INCIDENT


       It is a matter of common knowledge that Kolhapur, Sangli, Satara and
       adjoining cities in Western Maharashtra were flooded due to incessant
       torrential monsoon rains from 4th August 2019 onwards. The incident was
       covered by various news channels and print media across the nation.
       Insured’s shop was also flooded in the incident. We have gathered that
       the water level reached around 10-11 feet height around the insured’s
       premises due to flooding/inundation. Stocks stored in Insured’s shop were
       submerged into the muddy/contaminated water for 9 days. Thus
       stagnated flood water receded on 13th August 2019.


4.0    CAUSE OF DAMAGE


4.1    Heavy rains poured in Maharashtra (Bhiwandi, Kolhapur, Sangli, Karad,
       Ichalkarancji, Pune etc) Kerala & other many states from 26th July 2019 to
       12th August 2019. Due to this flood situation occurred at many places. The

                                                            Page 3|8
      incidence is well reported in TV and print media all over the countries.
      Due to this, water logged at insured’s named location.


4.2   Thus, based on our observations and information provided to us, the
      cause of loss could reasonably have attributed to flood.


5.0   OUR OBSERVATIONS & EXTENT OF DAMAGES


►     Description of The Risk

      garments/ clothing and imitation jewellery. The risk is located in double
      storied (G+1) RCC building situated at Mainroad, Bhilawadi, Tal Palus
      Sangli, Maharashtra-416303.


►     Observations


5.2   We carried out the survey on 17th August 2019, after the water level in the
      insured premises had receded. The entire street was covered with mud,
      various types of debris which had left behind after the flood water had
      receded. We carried out the survey on 17th August 2019. The insured is
      dealing in various types of garments. Insured’s shop is all most 8 ft above
      the road level. The water level was around 10 ft outside & 4 ft inside. The
      stock was drenched in water and mud. The damages can be broadly
      elaborated as under:
            Various cloths such as children ware, male and female dresses,
             inner wears school uniforms were found water affected. The mud
             marks and water marks observed on the cloths.

                                                            Page 4|8
      Insured was advised to clean the premises and segregate the damaged
      items and prepare the list of final damaged quantity for our final
      verification. Affected cloths and imitation jewellery were sent for drying
      purpose to minimize the loss.


5.3   Accordingly, upon receipt of the schedule/ list, we once again visited the
      insured’s premises on 23rd August 2019. The stock was inspected as per
      the list provided to us. Various types of men’s and women’s inner wear,
      Children wear, ladies Ghagra, odhani, T shirts, Scarf, etc. were found
      drenched in flood water. Mud stains were seen on the garments, which
      render them unfit for its intended use. The stock was emanating foul odor
      as these were submerged under water for almost 9 days. The external
      packing of paper and plastic was also damaged. The men’s wear such
      as jeans, pants, shirts etc. were also soaked in water and mud stains were
      present on them. The stock was not fit for sale due to the stains and odor
      and would not realize any value other than scrap value. The water
      soaked and contaminated clothes could not be sold as brand new ones.
      During inspection the final quantity of loss was ascertained & assessed
      the loss accordingly.


5.4   Thus, the liability, if any, is limited to the assessed quantity only.
