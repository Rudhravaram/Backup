TERMS? (REVIEW OF APPLICABLE
POLICY TERMS AND COMMENT)
NATURE AND EXTENT OF DAMAGE          :
At the time of our inspection, we observed that 4” compound wall on South side
completely collapsed approx. 175 feet in length. The land section was observed with
soil filling on south side. No weep holes were observed in the brick masonry. The
copier machine inside the store section was properly functional. The welding section
(robot welding) was covered with temporary tarpaulin cover inside the building. All
the machines and their panels were properly operational and production was in
process. Two machines inside the tool room were cleaned and were functional as
confirmed by the operators. The underside of the GI sheet gutter section (2 mtr. wide
and 45 feet mtr. in length) found rusty at various places. The rain water entered from
the gutter through its rusty cut portion.
We have also examined the top side of the Gutter. The rusty and leaked portions
were covered with water proofing bitumen sheets and preventive/repairs work was
in progress.
POLICY LIABILITY                        : Yet to ascertain

ISSUE                                   : #1. The loss location as per policy is Gat No
                                          Gate No. 1258 1259, Sanaswadi, whereas
                                          address as per our survey was Plant No-2,
                                          Gate No. 1231/1, Sanaswadi Pune.
                                          Thus loss location address do not match with
                                          policy.
                                          #2. The policy is having excess of Rs. 5 lakhs.
                                          The estimated loss, as per intimation, is
                                          around Rs. 2 lakhs.
                                          Hence, claim falls below the policy excess of
                                          Rs.5 lakhs.
                                          #3. The cause of loss as elaborated in our

                                          Pressure & Rusting) are excluded perils.
                                          In view of the above, the claim is not
                                          tenable under the captioned policy.
