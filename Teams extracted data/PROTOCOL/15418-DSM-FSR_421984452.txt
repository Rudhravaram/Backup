      have started the reinstatement work and they will share the reinstatement
      invoice & payment proof once the work is completed. Our current
      assessment is subject to submission of the invoice and payment proof from
      the insured. Upon receipt of the same, the deductions / additions done in

      Being civil work notional value of Rs. 500.00 is only deducted.

      underinsurance is not worked out & the sum insured is assumed to be
      adequate. Furthermore, the policy has escalation clause and also being IAR
      policy, underinsurance up to 15% is waived off.
