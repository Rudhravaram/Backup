TERMS? (REVIEW OF APPLICABLE
POLICY TERMS AND COMMENT)
NATURE AND EXTENT OF DAMAGE                :
At the time of our inspection, we observed that 4” compound wall on South side -
approx. 175 feet in long – was completely collapsed. Considerable back filling was
observed on one side of the wall, leading to elevation difference between the
ground of the insured and ground on the other side of the wall. No weep holes were
observed in the brick masonry. The wall required reconstruction.
It was further informed by the insured that water entered inside the workshop and fell
over the machines. The rain water entered from the gutter through its rusty cut
portion. The underside of the GI sheet gutter section (2 mtr. wide and 45 mtr. in length)
found rusty at various places. We have also examined the top side of the Gutter. The
rusty and leaked portions were covered with water proofing bitumen sheets and
preventive/repairs work was in progress. The machines were inspected. The copier
machine inside the store section was found properly functional. The welding section
(robot welding) was covered with temporary tarpaulin cover inside the building. All
the machines and their panels were properly operational and production was in
process. Two machines inside the tool room were cleaned and were functional as
confirmed by the operators. Thus, there was no loss to machines. The damages to the
gutter were purely due to rust, developed over a period of time.
POLICY LIABILITY                           : No
REASON FOR CLOSURE                         :
#1. The loss location as per policy is Gat No Gate No. 1258 1259, Sanaswadi, whereas
address as per our survey was Plant No-2, Gate No. 1231/1, Sanaswadi Pune.
Thus, loss location address do not match with policy.
Hence, claim falls below the policy excess of Rs.5 lakhs.
#2. The cause of loss as elaborated in our earlier para i.e gradual deterioration (soil
Pressure & Rusting) are excluded perils.
#3. The policy is having excess of Rs. 5 lakhs. The estimated loss, as per intimation, is

around Rs. 2 lakhs. The tentative loss working also falls below the excess.


In view of the above, the claim is not tenable under the captioned policy. Our
observations were conveyed to the Insured vide email dated 19th June 2019. Now, as
advised by you, we are closing our file as NO CLAIM.
