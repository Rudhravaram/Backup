4.3     I am residing at the above mentioned address since 9 years with my
        family. My father is the owner of the Dia Chemie factory since 1968,
        which deals in trading and supply of chemicals and pharmaceutical
        raw materials. On 14th July 2017 at around 9.30 Rounak Jayant Cheda
        called me on my mobile to inform that there was fire due to unknown
        reason in the godown no D2/18, 19 & 20 where my material was stored.
        After information I left from Mumbai and reached at around 2.00 pm at
        Rounak Warehousing Service & observed 3 godown had caught fire.
        The fire was intense and the fire brigade officials were trying to
        extinguish the fire using water and foam. As different types of chemicals
        were stored in the godown, the fire became severe and hard to control.
        The fire was still not under control and at 6.00 pm I went home.


4.4     On 15th July 2017 @ 3.30 I came to Bhivandi, also other traders had
        reached the location. The fire was completely extinguished. It was
        observed that the stock of chemical stored in drum was affected while
        the ceiling of the godown had collapsed. At around 5.00 pm we all
        went home. My material is stored in the godown as mentioned above
        and I have no idea on how the fire start.

        However, we have translated the same giving the gist of the incidence
        narrated therein.


5.0     CAUSE OF FIRE


5.1     As informed, the damages were noticed on 14th July 2017 @ around 8.00



Die Chemie - 13154/ICICI/17-18                         Kamal Biyani Associates   5
        am by warehouse labours while opening the shutter. Fire rapidly spread
        beyond control due to nature of contents. The exact cause of fire is not
        known. The findings of the investigator appointed by the insurers is
        awaited till the time of release of the report.


5.2     The supporting documents such as Fire brigade report, Police Jabab,
        panchnama were provided to us which mention the cause of loss was
        due to some source. However, as we gather, the godown operator
        have stated to the investigator that fire occurred due to one of the
        chemical came to the contact with leakage of water.


6.0     EXTENT OF DAMAGE


6.1     We had visited the premises on 17th July 2017 & thereafter on 24th August
        2017.


6.2     Fire was extinguished; however, fumes were coming from debris. Three
        adjoining godowns were affected. The godowns were having physical
        marking as RCC-9, RCC-10 & RCC-11. Warehouse operator (Ronak
        Warehousing) informed that these were godown no. D2-17, D2-18,D2-19
        as per their operations. Fire reportedly originated in one of these
        godowns and was spread to these three godowns. The building was
        considerably damaged. The entire RCC roof had collapsed. The side
        walls were also damaged. The flooring was also damaged.


6.3     The entire stock to the extent visible was burnt. The molten slurry of the
        stocks had flown outside godown as well. MS/plastic barrels were gutted
        completely. We could not enter inside the burnt godowns due to safety
        reasons, as fumes (possibly poisonous due to involvement of unknown
        chemicals) were emanating. The building was also in dilapidating stage
        due to fire.



Die Chemie - 13154/ICICI/17-18                            Kamal Biyani Associates   6
6.4     During inspection, warehouse operator and labours were interviewed. It
        was informed that the godowns were storing goods pertaining to various
        parties. The stocks mainly consisted of chemicals. These were stored in
        PP/HDPE/MS Barrels. Some of the stocks was in granule, powder form.
        The entire stocks which was available and visible inside the all the three
        godowns was completely gutted. It was informed that nothing could be
        moved out of the godown during/after the fire. The burnt remains of
        PP/HDPE/MS barrels were available inside the godowns. The burnt
        remains of the plastic granules were also visible in the debris.


6.5     During our visit, we had visited other godowns of the same operator to
        verify the contents. These were also storing similar kind of chemicals.
        However, through our physical inspection, inquiries with the labours it
        was confirmed that the godowns visited by us did not store goods
        pertaining to the insured.


6.6     The warehouse operator had not shown any documents. Post survey,
        we had given a detailed questionnaire to the warehouse operator. The
        questionnaire is not addressed completely. In answer to some of the
        question, it is mentioned “Attached:, however, nothing was attached.
        The copy is placed as Annexure to the report.


6.7     To summarize, no documents were made available from the warehouse
        operator. The extent of damaged stocks was worked out from the
        documents submitted by the insured. The details are elaborated in the
        later part of the report.


6.8     Thus, liability if any is limited to affected stock of Dia Chemie.
