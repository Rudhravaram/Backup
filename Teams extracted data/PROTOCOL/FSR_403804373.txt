 5.0    CAUSE OF DAMAGE


 5.1    During our visit, the insured’s premises were thoroughly inspected and
        photographed. The exact cause of fire could not be ascertained at

Ntex- 15248 /ICICI /1 9-20           Kamal Biy ani Associ ates    P a g e 4 | 11
        the time of inspection. Fire brigade was reportedly called to put off
        the fire. Police authorities were also informed about the fire incident.


 5.2    The insurers had appointed forensic investigators (Bombay Forensic,
        Mumbai) for the claim. The investigator carried out detailed
        investigation and concluded as under…


        (Quote)


        Based on the Fire Forensic and Analysis of the fire affected site of
        incident followed by search, identification, collection and analysis of
        physical    evidence,   scrutiny   of   documentary    evidence,      it    is
        concluded that the incident of fire reported to have occurred on
        07th January, 2020 at around 02:30 AM at G-31/1, old MIDC, Satara
        was;
        a) not due to any natural causes,
        b) not due to explosion & implosion,
        c) not due to electric short circuit, but
        d) due to external source of origin of fire, it originated in Amit paper
        work company and then it propagated to the insured’s company
        through the open hole access kept to slab for proposed steps
        construction from underground floor to ground floor. In this case, it is
        negligence of insured, if insured would have closed the open hole of
        slab then the fire could have not entered in the insured’s godown.
        Amit paper work owner was non-cooperative to provide the CCTV
        footage of his premises and making various stories. Later, provided
        hard disc through courier which was found fully burnt and look like it
        burnt deliberately.


        (Unquote)


 5.3    The entire investigation report is part of the report and attached with
        report for ready reference. As per the report, the fire originated in

Ntex- 15248 /ICICI /1 9-20             Kamal Biy ani Associ ates   P a g e 5 | 11
        Amit Paper Company and then propagated to the insured’s
        premises through the open duct access in the slab (which was kept
        for proposed construction of steps from basement to ground floor). It
        should be noted that the insured had taken the premises (only
        ground floor) on rent. The police panchanama also confirms the
        incident & they had concluded that the fire was accidental (Akasmit
        Jalit). The insured had no control over the basement premises and
        activities carried in it. Hence, the fire which resulted in damages to
        the insured’s stock is purely accidental.


 5.4    Thus, based on our inspection, investigator’s report & other
        supporting documents the cause of loss is attributed to accidental
        fire.

 6.5    The sound stock and partially affected stock was taken out from the
        premises. The sound stock was inspected and jointly quantified. The
        burnt debris was not in quantifiable condition, still we tried to quantify
        the partially affected stock to the extent possible. The loss quantity
        was arrived at after deducting the safe stock from the total stock
        (which is maintained centrally at the main office). The system total

 8.0    METHODOLOGY OF ASSESSMENT OF LOSS


 8.1    Our assessment of loss is based on our inspection & documents
        submitted by the Insured. The supporting documents are enclosed
        with the report. Following points are crucial from the assessment of
        loss point of view. ..


 8.2    Following points are crucial from the assessment point of view…


        ►      Stocks


         i)    As per PSR report, total stock at the time of loss was Rs.
               5,855,999.99. As per joint physical verification safe stock was
               works out as Rs. 1,552,324.00. Thus, remaining stock of Rs.
               4,303,675.00 was damaged in the fire. The rates are considered
               on the basis of the invoices provided by the insured. On sample
               basis these were verified during our inspection. We have
               confirmed the damages, however, as the damaged items were
               in large quantities which were completely burnt and mixed,
               exact quantification was not possible. Hence, we have
               deducted 3% against quantity and rate variance.


         ii)   The total stock at loss location taken on the first day of our visit
               after the loss and it was confirmed that the PSR (physical Stock
               record) is centrally generated report. We have requested for
               CA certified stock statement. It was informed by the Insured
               that they would submit the same after the nationwide
               lockdown for the COVID 19 is lifted.


        (-)    Depreciation

        (-)    Salvage


        iv)    The damaged items were not fit for the intended use, however
               they would have realize scrap value. The insurers carried out the
               salvaging through their internal salvage team. The salvage
               value    realized   was   Rs.   4,87,133.00   (Excluding   GST)    by
               auctioning. Insured has provided sale invoices for the same.
               Accordingly, the salvage value is deducted in the assessment.


        (-)    Adequacy


        v)     Total stock as on date of loss as Rs. 5,856,000.00. Sum insured
               availed for the stock is Rs. 5,000,000.00. Thus stock is
               underinsured to the extent of Rs. 856,000.00 and percentage of
               underinsurance is 15%. Accordingly deduction were made in
               assessment part of report.


        (-)    Excess


        vi)    As per policy, excess is 5% of claim amount subject to minimum
               of Rs. 10,000.00. Deductions were made accordingly.


        (-)    Application of Exclusion ‘7’


        vii)   The origin of fire is from other premises (Amit Paper Company)
               hence no deduction were made.


 8.3    The assessment of loss works out to Rs. 2,977,602.00. The detailed
        assessment is attached as Annexures to the report.


        The assessment has been explained to the Insured, who have given
