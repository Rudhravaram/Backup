2.0    INCIDENT


2.1    A low pressure area formed over southeast & adjoining east central Arabian
       Sea and Lakshadweep area in the early morning (0530 hrs. IST) of 31st May
       2020. It intensified into deep depression over east central Arabian Sea in the
       early morning (0530 hrs. IST) and into cyclonic storm “NISARGA” in the noon
       (1130 hrs. IST) of 2nd June. It gradually recurved northeastwards and
       intensified into a severe cyclonic storm in the early morning (0530 hrs. IST) of
       3rd June 2020. It made landfall near the coastal region of Alibag in
       Maharashtra with wind speeds gusting from 100-120 Kmph. Various parts of
       Raigard, Pune, Ahemdnagar, Nashik and Western Maharashtra region were
       lashed by gusty winds and relentless rains. The Navi Mumbai (Taloja) &
       Panvel region were also affected as the cyclone passed through the region.
       Various claims were reported from the area.


2.2    The insured had taken a warehouse at S.No.78/2 & 78/3, Wavaje Village,
       Tal-Panvel, Dist-Raigad-410208 on lease for storing the fertilizer bags. The
       warehouse was being managed by Nishant Infin Pvt. Ltd. As informed the
       warehouse was recently taken on rent in the month of March-April 2020. The
       stock of fertilizers of Smartchem Technologies was stored at the warehouse.
       As informed on 3rd June 2020, due to cyclone Nisarga, strong winds flown
       through the Navi Mumbai region due to which the coated sheets of one
       side got uprooted and fell down. As a result that section was exposed to the
       rains and the bags stacked in that section were affected by the rainwater.

4.0   Nature & Extent of Damages


4.1   As mentioned in the earlier section, the side cladding sheets of the
      warehouse had uprooted and thereby the stock placed at that section was
      exposed to the heavy rains during the cyclone. The stack was of S: 10
      (Mahadhan Smartek 10:26:26) fertilizer and around 470 MT quantity (each
      bag weight 50kg) was stored in the stack. The bags kept on the top side as
      well as on the side exposed to the open area were found with water traces.
      The fertilizer was directly packed inside the PP bags. Few bags were opened
      and inside the material was found turned into paste form. Also the bags of
      N: 24 (Mahadhan Power 24:24:0) kept beside the stack were affected. The
      material was manufactured in the month of April 2020 (as per the details
      mentioned on the bag). The exact quantity of affected bags could not be
      known as the stack was huge and bags in the middle layers were not
      accessible. The quantity of affected bags could have only be known once
      the sound bags are removed from the heap and the affected ones are
      segregated. Prima facie it was suspected that around 60-70 MT of S:10 and
      25 MT of N:24 might be affected. However, we had advised the insured to
      start the segregation activity at the earliest so that the exact loss quantum
      can be ascertained.


4.2   The insured had segregated the damaged bags and the quantity is as
      under:
      N24: 19 MT
      S10: 5 MT
      This quantity was inspected by us through video call (due to travel
      restrictions due to pandemic, the visit could not be arranged). The bags
      were opened and shown to us. The photographs & videos were also shared
      to us. The above material was found damaged & not fit for sale after the

                                                              Page 3|7
      segregation activity.


5.0   ASSESSMENT OF LOSS


5.1   The insured had submitted below documents in support of their claim:
         1. Claim bill
         2. Claim form
         3. Sale invoices
         4. Government circular on subsidy
         5. Total stock as on date of loss at all locations (being floater policy)


5.2   The stock of finished goods was damaged in the incident. The insured had
      claimed on the production cost of the stock. The insured had provided sale
      invoices for both the items. It was observed that the insured received subsidy
      from government on sale of the fertilizer stocks. Hence, the sale value
      mentioned in the invoice was lesser than the production cost. The claimed
      rate was less than the sum of sale invoice rate plus government subsidy per
      MT. Hence, the insured’s claimed rate was found reasonable and
      accordingly, considered in the assessment working.


5.3   ► Depreciation:
      Not applicable on stocks.


      ► Salvage:
      The insured had provided salvage value offer of Rs. 6000 per MT for the
      damaged stock. The value was found reasonable considering the nature of
      damages and hence was accepted. Accordingly, the value of Rs.
      1,44,000.00 is deducted towards salvage.


      ► Adequacy:
      The policy was on floater basis covering around 292 locations as per the

      covered under the policy annexure. The insured had provided closing stock
      as on date of loss at all the locations. The value was Rs. 137,96,16,154.00
      while the sum insured is Rs. 250,00,00,000.00. Hence the stocks are
      adequately covered.


      ► Excess:
      As per policy & as confirmed by the insurers, the excess is 5% of claim
      amount subject to minimum of INR 25000 for sum insured (stock value) at
      particular location more than INR 10 Cr to INR 100 Cr, same is applied and
      deducted.


5.4   The assessment of loss works out to Rs. 4,34,945.00. The detailed
      assessment is attached as Annexure I to the report.


      The assessment was shared to the insured vide mail dated 21st August 2020
