 3.0   INCIDENT


 3.1   It was well known that Bhiwandi, Kolhapur, Sangli, Satara, Karad
       and adjoining cities in Western Maharashtra were flooded due
       to incessant torrential monsoon rains from 4th August 2019
       onwards. Insured’s godown was also flooded in the incident. It
       was informed that the water level reached around 5-9 ft height
       at and around the premises due to flooding/inundation. Building
       /Stocks were submerged into the muddy/contaminated water
       for 4-5 days. The stagnated flood water receded on 13th August
       2019.


 4.0   CAUSE OF DAMAGE


 4.1   Heavy rains poured in Maharastra (Bhivandi, Kalyan, Badlapur,
       Kolhapur,    Sangli,   Karad,   Belgam,   Ichalkarancji,   Satara,
       Hatkarangale, Meeraj etc), Karnataka, Kerala & other many
       states from 26th July 2019 to 12th August 2019. Due to this flood
       situation occurred at many places. The incidence is well
       reported in TV and print media all over the countries. Due to this,
       water logged at insured’s named location.


 4.2   Thus, based on our observations and information provided to us,
       the cause of loss could reasonably have attributed to flood.

       premises thoroughly on 15th August 2019. It was reported that
       there was inundation at their premises. The water level was
       around 9 ft at the inside & at outside premises.        During our

       was done jointly. Final quantity of loss was ascertained &

       provided to us. Hence 20% deduction were made for rate &
