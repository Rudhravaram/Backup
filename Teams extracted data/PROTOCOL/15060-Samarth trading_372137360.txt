4.0    REASON FOR CLOSER


       Pursuant to instructions, we have visited loss location at Sukhsagar, Katraj,
       Pune for survey. Insured is a distributor of Patanjali and HUL. It was
       reported that due to flood water, FMCG stock got damaged. At the time
       of our inspection, we observed following things:
          1) Location covered under the Policy held by Insured is " Sr. no. 11 23,
             shop no 1112, Hingane khurd, Pune " whereas loss location address,
             where we have carried our survey is " Sr no 16, Hissa no 2 Near
             Aambamata mandir, Sukhsagar, Katraj, Pune. Thus loss location is
             not covered under the said Policy.
          2) The stock shown to us was observed affected with the flood

             water. The damaged stock is fast moving consumer goods of
             Patanjali and HUL. Most of stock is consisting of cosmetics and
             eatable products. It should be used within the specified time.

                 During our survey the damaged stock shown to us for inspection
                 was found beyond expiry date and usage period. Thus claimed
                 stock is dead stock.
        In view above, the claim lodged by Insured, is not tenable. Our
        observations were conveyed to the insured vide email dated 5th
        November 2019. Now as advised by Insurance company we are closing
        our file as “No claim”.
