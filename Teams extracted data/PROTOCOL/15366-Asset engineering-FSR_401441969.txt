        ➢ SUPPOSED CAUSE                :   Reported storm coupled with rain


        ➢ INCIDENT


    It was reported that on 16th April 2020 due to storm coupled with rain the roof
    sheets (2 FRP sheets for light) broken and increased air pressure inside the shop
    caused damages to another AC sheet of the factory building. The AC sheets were
    broken and rain water entered & splashed over the shop floor and machinery. The
    damaged sheets were replaced to avoid aggravation of loss and machines were
    covered with tarpaulin. The surrounding premises was also sustained damages
    due to storm and Electricity supply was also shut down.


        ➢ NATURE & EXTENT OF DAMAGE


    I       We were unable to carry out physical survey due to ongoing Covid-19
            country wide lock-down. We had conducted virtual survey today and
            inspected the premises over video call. Our observations are as below....

            1. Total five main machines - 2 CNC turning & 3 VMC - Milling inside the
               shop floor were observed covered with tarpaulin.
            2. Water and watermarks, broken pieces of sheets were observed inside
               the shop floor.
            3. Few AC sheets of roof found replaced and a portion is yet to cover.
               We advised Insured to cover the same at the earliest to avoid any
               aggravation of loss.
            4. 1 CNC and 1 VMC was observed with water marks on external body.
               Other three machines observed safe apparently.
            5. The    electric supply   was    not    yet   restored    in   MIDC    as
               maintenance work is going on.


    II   Further on 28th April 2020, we once again have carried out virtual survey on
         video call. The covered machines were open in front of us. Mr. Omkar Nikam
         (Repairer & maintenance engineer) was present at loss location. After
         restoring of Electrical supply, the machines were switched ON. All the five
         machines (CNC-2nos & VMS-3nos) were started and checked. During
         inspection no operational errors or warning alarms were observed on the
         above five machines. The machines were completely in operational
         condition after date of loss. We have observed the movements of x and y
         axis and found in order. During video calling & discussion with repairer it was
         informed that abnormal sound heard from two of the machines CNC LX20T
         and VMC PX 20. It was also informed that the sound heard was similar to
         due non-operational condition from last few weeks and guideways and
         other moving parts may got dried. We have advised repairer to take proper
         measures and ensure that the entire lubrication system working fine and
         then only start the machines for production purpose.


            ➢ REASON FOR CLOSURE:

         after taking trial, all machines are working in OK condition and now he wish
