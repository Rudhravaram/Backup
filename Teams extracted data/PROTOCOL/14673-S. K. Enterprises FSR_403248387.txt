       fire tenders reached at the site & extinguished the fire @ 11.00 a.m.
       (21.6.2019). We lost around 25 to 30 lakhs stock in this fire”.

 5.0   CAUSE OF DAMAGE


 5.1   At the time of our inspection, Insured’s premises were thoroughly
       inspected by us. Exact cause of fire could not be ascertained at the
       time of inspection. Fire brigade was reportedly called to put off the
       fire. Police complaint was also reportedly lodged.


 5.2   However, as the cause of fire was not very clear, we advised insurers
       to engage the services of a professional investigator. Accordingly,
       Bombay Forensic, Mumbai was appointed by the insurers. The
       investigator carried out detailed investigation and concluded as
       under…


       (Quote)


       Based on the Fire Forensic and Analysis of the fire affected site of
       incident followed by search, identification, collection, testing and
       analysis of physical evidence, scrutiny of documentary evidence, it is
       concluded that the incident of fire reported to have occurred on
       20th June, 2019 at around 2:30 am was,
       a) not due to electrical short circuit,
       b) not due to any natural causes but,
       c) Higher possibility of human intervention by igniting the material
       which was kept inside the go-down by initiating and burning by
       someone who has the motive means and opportunity to carry out
       the malicious act.
       Motive: a) Expiry range of product is very less i.e. about 15 days to 6
       months. Where we have found that the recognizable products are
       expired in the burnt debris.
        b) Insured has 60 lakhs cc Loan pending.
       c) Insured is not willing to provide the actual financial records.

       The entire investigation report is part of the report and attached with
       report for ready reference.


       During our survey also, we had observed that the available debris of
       the stock was not commensurate with the initial claim amount of Rs.
       50.00 Lakhs. When probed further, the insured agreed that the stocks
       is not to that level. The stocks shown in the bank statement is also
       very high. In most of the stocks statement the value is more than
       crores. These aspects are highlighted in the investigation report in
       detail.


       Thus, the fire was not accidental. Thus, the claim is not admissible.

  ►    Building:
 6.3                                             During our visit on 21st June

                                                 moderately    affected.      The
                                                 painting of the wall was

                                                 were blackened/broken. The

       was affected. Some stocks which were packed in the plastic jars,
       found soot affected. Some stock was lying outside the godown. It
       was informed that this was done during firefighting. Due to extensive
       damages, the physical quantification was impossible.

 8.0   METHODOLOGY OF ASSESSMENT OF LOSS


 8.1   The claim lodged by Insured is not admissible. However, based on
       documents submitted by the Insured and our inspection, we have
       assessed the loss for academic purpose and without the admission of
       liability.


 8.3   Following points are crucial from the assessment point of view…


       ►      Stocks


         I    As damaged stock was completely damaged in fire & turned in
              the ashes, hence physical quantification of damages stock was
              not possible. Insured has preferred the claim of Rs. 29,31,645 /-
              (as per CA certified Balance sheet as on date of loss less safe
              stock submitted by Insured). We have relied upon the following
              documents while assessing the loss :-

                 4. GSTR Details


              To arrive at total stock as on date of loss, we have done
              detailed analysis of insured’s accounts, past three years
              certified Balance sheets, Purchase & sale details as per monthly
              GST returns, valuation of safe inventory, Purchase /sale Invoices
              etc. Based on above documents, finally entire stock as on date
              of loss was worked out - as per details attached with the
              assessment sheet, against Insured working (CA certified
              Balance sheet). Considering derived entire stock and safe
              stock, the value of damaged stock worked out. The detailed
              assessment sheets with annexure, are attached.


              We have received written confirmation from the insured that
              there is no other godown for storing of stock in any form other
              than the above location.


        (-)   Depreciation

              value is done.

                  underinsurance.


        (-)       Excess
        VI        As per policy, excess is 5% of claim amount subject to minimum
                  of Rs. 10,000.00. Deductions were made accordingly.


        (-)       Application of Exclusion ‘7’
        VII       The exact origin of fire is not known to us. Further, insured have
                  claimed only stock. Thus, the deduction is not applicable.


 8.4    Thus, the net assessed loss (academic purpose)
        works out Rs. 18,82,354.00.
