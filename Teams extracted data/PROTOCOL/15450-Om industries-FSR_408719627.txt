2.0   Insurers have appointed us on 5th June 2020 for the survey. Pursuant to
      instructions, we had visited the loss premises 6th June 2020 and subsequently
      thereafter on 22nd June 2020. In continuation, the Insured were requested
      to   submit    the    requisite   documents.     On    the    basis     of   the
      documents/information made available to us, we are issuing the final
      report.


3.0   INCIDENT


3.1   During our survey Mr. Tushar Bamb (Partner of firm) have conducted us and
      narrated the incident. It was reported that on 3rd June 2020 there was
      cyclone (named as-Nisarg cyclone) along with heavy rain fall. Due to this
      Insured’s premises was got affected. Stock of various paper material was
      damaged.


4.0   CAUSE OF LOSS


4.1   Severe Cyclonic Storm Nisarga hit Maharashtra, Gujarat region and other
      state on 3rd June 2020. Heavy rain continued further till 2-3 days. Due to this
      cyclone, severe damages were occurred to life and property at many
      places in the state. The incidence is well reported in TV and print media all
      over the countries.


4.2   Thus, based on our observations and information provided to us, the cause
      of loss could reasonably attribute to storm associated with heavy rain due
      Nisarga Cyclone.


5.0   Nature & Extent of Damages

      inspected by us. Basically insured- Om industry is a manufacturer of

      tissue paper, paper cup etc. Construction of building is of brick wall
      with roof of GI sheets. Water was already receded at the time of our
      inspection. Inundation level was measured at various places. It was
      around 1-2 inch. The stock consisted of different paper roll, plates,
      cup, sheet was found affected by water. Due to water ingression
      the paper had sagged and lost its strength. Thus, the damaged
      paper cannot be used for its intended purpose (for making cup,
      plate, container etc). Water traces were visible on stock.
