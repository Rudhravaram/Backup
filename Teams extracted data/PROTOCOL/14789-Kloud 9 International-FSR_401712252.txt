3.0    INCIDENT


3.1    During our visit, Mr. Sachine Padhey conducted us around and
       narrated the incident. It was informed that, on the intervening
       night of 3rd & 4th August 2019 @ 4.00 am -5.00 am, there was
       heavy rainfall at Vasai road, Thane area due to which various
       surrounding regions were flooded. The insured’s premises were
       also affected. The water was removed prior to our visit, however,
       the water level marks at around 3 ft at out side of the shed and
       around 18 inches-2ft inside the shed in all four compartments
       were clearly visible. Flood water entered the warehouse, due to
       this stocks of utensils which were at the ground level, corrugated
       boxes, Tags and stickers, P & M were got affected.


4.0    CAUSE OF DAMAGE VIS-À-VIS ADMISSIBILITY



4.1    During our inspection the inundation level was clearly visible
       inside the insured’s premises. It was measured at various places.
       3 ft at out side of the shed and around 18 inches-2 ft inside the
       shed. Investigators also opined that based on the Metrological
       Rainfall analysis, there was major rainfall in the Vasai-Virar region
       between 3rd August, 2019 - 5th August.



4.2    Thus based on our observations, investigation report, information
       provided to us, the cause of loss could reasonably have
       attributed to flood/ inundation.

      ➢   Our Observations:


5.3       We carried out the survey on 8th August 2019. The water level was
          around 2 ft inside the premises & around 3 ft at out side the shed.
          The 25 inch platforms were also found moist. It was reorted that
          some stocks of utensils were stored on the plastic pallets on one
          above other. Some stock was stored in cardboard boxes. Bowls
          were stored in individual plastic bags. Brief details of our
          observations are as follows:
          Stock of stainless steel:
             1. The stock of utensils kept on lower part of pallets were
                mainly affected due to flood water. It contained utensil
                such as spoons, glasses, mugs, casseroles of stainless steel
                and chromium plated. Stock kept on upper part was
                found in safe condition.
             2. Some of the stock were stored in plastic wrapping and
                then into corrugated cardboard boxes. These cardboard
                boxes were placed on plastic pallets. Throughout, the
                bottom 2 layers were drenched in water.
             3. Some items were kept in only plastic covering. On
                inspection it was found that the water entered inside the
                plastic packing.
                Machinery, corrugated boxes,Tags & stockers:
             4. The machinery such as spot welding machine, weighing
                machine, found water affected. Empty corrugated
                cardboard boxes Tags & stickers were also found
                damaged in flood water.


5.4       The affected material was taken out separately from the
          packages and cleaning and polishing activity was in progress




14789/ICICI/1920-Kloude 9 International
       prior to our visit. The affected stock contains numerous items in
       large quantity. Further we have advised Insured to segregate the
       affected material and provide us the detailed list with estimation
       of loss.


5.5    Thereafter Insured had cleaned up the flood affected stock
       using chemical method (de-rusting method using calcium
       powder). After such exercise         flood affected stock became
       saleable at some discount. Some of the stocks was completely
       lost, as the puff got swollen and cracks were developed in the
       containers.


5.6    Out of damaged parts, stock (stainless steel) is only covered
       under the Policy. Damages to coagurrated boxes, tags &
       stickers, P & M are not covered under the Policy. Thus, the liability,
       if any, is limited to that stock only.

6.3    The claim is lodged under Standard Fire & Special Perils Policy.
       The operated peril – flood-inundation – is covered under the
       policy. The policy was effective as on date of loss & location is
       covered under the policy. Thus, the claim lodged by the insured
       falls within the purview of the policy issued to and held by the
       insured


7.0    ASSESSMET OF LOSS


7.1    Our assessment of loss is based on our inspection & documents
       submitted by the Insured. The supporting documents are
       enclosed with the report. Following points are crucial from the
       assessment of loss point of view. ..



       i)    The affected stock contains numerous items in large
             quantity. Practically, piece level inspection/ verification
             could not be possible in the subject case. Camaparatively
             stock kept at lower level was more damaged. Stock stored
             at upper portion was found in sound condition. So based
             on apprppriate proportion and inundation level damaged
             items were segregated, list was prepared and same was
             verified jointly at the time of our inspection;.




14789/ICICI/1920-Kloude 9 International
       ii)    Damaged utensile were repolished and repacked by
              Insured after exercise of chemical method. Even after such
              exercise, some of the items were totally lost. The recovered
              one also lost its value and hence, discount need to be
              offered. Insured have claimed Rs.41,66,625.60 for the stock.
              As the damaged items were in large quantity exact
              quantification is not possible. Hence gross value is
              obtained by deduction of 15% for likely        variation in
              quantity &/or rate and 5% for non moving / slow moving
              stock. Insured had demanded for different allowances of
              different items. However, exact details/basis were not
              furnished. Morover, the repolishing cost would differ on the
              basis of the items and extent of damage suffered.
              Considering the large quantity, the exercise required
              sufficient time. This time factor would obviously lead to
              further damages. Considering these aspects, based on the
              discussion   with   the   insured   and   market   inquiries,
              cumulative damage allowance (repolishing expenses,
              repacking expenses, likely discount etc.) of 40% was
              reasonable. Accordingly, we have arrived at damaged
              value as Rs. 26,03,362.00.



       iii)   Underinsurance

              The total stock as on date of loss as Rs. 8231685.90. Sum
              insured availed for the stock is Rs. 40000000. Thus stock is
              adequately covered and there is no underinsurance.



       iv)    Excess

              The applicable excess 5% of the claim amount sub to min
              of Rs. 10,000/- is deducted.




14789/ICICI/1920-Kloude 9 International
8.0     Assessment of loss         works out Rs.24,73,194.00. The
       detailed working is attached as Annexure to the report.
       Our assessment was conveyed to Insured who have given
       consent for the same wide their mail dated 13th May 2020.

10.0   CONCLUSIONS


10.1   The cause of loss is flood/inundation, the peril that is covered
