5.0   Nature & Extent of Damages


5.1   We have carried out survey on 18th June 2020 during which the premises
      were inspected and photographed. Broadly our observations are as
      follows:
         ➢ Building:
         1. Front side ACP panels and ACP sheet were uprooted/deformed
            and need to replaced.
         2. Main entrance glass paneling was damaged. Need to repair.
         3. On fourth floor Patient ward, right side wall was observed with
            crack near column and beam. It needs plastering and painting.
         ➢ Machineries/Equipment:
            We observed that equipment such as Ventilator, analyzer, NIBP
            monitor, X-ray, CT scan machine, SWD diathermy machine was
            non- functional. High voltage, reverse current lead to machinery
            break down. Fire was not generated in these machines. Only one
            wall mounting fan was observed with burnt marks. As per the
            Policy, coverage is taken for only building. Hence damages to
            machineries/ equipment are not covered.

            to surge in voltage. Various parts such as mother board, power
            supply card, relay card, fuse cards were reportedly damaged
            and need repairs. Lifts are damaged due to spike/surge which is
            excluded under fire Policy.
