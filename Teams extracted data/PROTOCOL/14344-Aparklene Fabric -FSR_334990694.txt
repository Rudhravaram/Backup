3.0     ABOUT THE INSURED AND TRADE PRACTICE


3.1     Bhiwandi is major textile manufacturing hub. It manufactures cotton,
        polyester cotton fabric. The main stages in the textiles business are…


             Manufacturing of yarn – Spinning Mills
             Weaving of grey cloth on looms - Weavers
             Dyeing of cloth in process house – Process House


Aparklene Fabrics –14344/ICICI/18-19                          Kamal Biyani Associates   3
             Marketing of cloth - Traders


3.2     Most of the traders outsource these activities. Hence, there would be
        standalone Spinning Mills, Weavers, Process House and Traders. In
        addition, brokers would be engaged to execute outsourcing activities.


3.3     Generally, a trader procures yarn from spinner and send it to a
        weaver. After weaving, the weaver would deliver the grey cloth/fabric
        to a process house nominated by the trader. Sometimes grey cloth
        would be directly purchased by the trader. After dying the finished
        cloth/fabric would be delivered to the godown of the trader. These
        activities are coordinated by a broker nominated by the trader, who
        charge brokerage to the trader.


3.4     During this entire process, material belonging to the trader would be
        lying at third party premises such as….
             Yarn at weaver
             Grey cloth at weaver
             Grey cloth at process house
             Finished cloth at process house


3.5     The storage period varies from case to case. The trader &/or process
        house buy insurance coverage to insure the material whilst in their
        custody.

        had come to deliver the Taka at the premises. The fire was noticed by
        him. Thereafter, surrounding neighbors came together. I have received

        & came with them at factory. Fire brigade team have extinguished the
        fire. Fire was under control @ 5. p.m. The fire was due to electric short

 4.3    The incident report provided by the insured is in vernacular. However,
        we have translated the same giving the gist of the incidence narrated
        therein.


5.0     CAUSE OF LOSS

5.1     Cause of loss was fire; however, exact cause of fire and origin is not

5.3     Thus, based on the information gathered during survey and our
        inspection, the cause of loss/damage could be attributed to
        accidental fire.

Aparklene Fabrics –14344/ICICI/18-19                     Kamal Biyani Associates   5
        premises. The premises were inspected thoroughly. The insured is
        engaged in the business of Grey fabric manufacturing since 1998. The
        affected premises utilized for the storage of yarn and finished goods

        polyester cotton after doubling in loose and packed form in
        cardboard boxes were completely burnt. Exact quantity could not be
        ascertained. It was reported that the stock was maintained in soft

        have preferred claim for Rs. 7,96,254.85.

8.2     Following points are crucial from the assessment of loss point of view:




Aparklene Fabrics –14344/ICICI/18-19                    Kamal Biyani Associates   7
         ►     Stocks
          I    The stock was burnt to various extent. The affected stock was
               burnt beyond physically quantification/identification. Insured
               have provided us supporting invoices in support of the claim. The
               loss is assessed on the basis of such documents/information. The
               quantity could not be identified thus, we have deducted 15%
               towards quantity variations. Some of supporting bills were as old
               as 2017. Hence, dead stock deduction of 7.5% was also made.


         (-)   Salvage
         II    Based on the severity of fire and the stock being completely
               gutted in the fire, the stock would not realize any salvage value.
               Hence, we have not deducted any value, while assessing the
               loss.


         (-)   Adequacy of Insurance Coverage – Underinsurance
         III   Insured have provided provisional balance sheet for the period of
               1.4.2018 to 24.1.2019. as per porivisional balance sheet the total
               stock as on date of loss was Rs. 3,14,59,698/-


               Insured have provided us two policies bearing no 1001/160749138
               & 1001/160751643 for total sum insured of Rs. 4,80,00,000/- (Rs.
               4,50,00,000/- & 30,00,000/-) against stock of Rs. 3,14,59,698/- as
               per provisional balance sheet as on date of loss. Thus, the stock is
               adequately covered & there is no underinsurance.


         (-)   Excess
         IV    The excess applicable under the policy is 5% of claim amount
               subject to a minimum of INR 10,000.00. Thus, Rs. 27,367/- is

               deducted.


         (-)   Chances of Recovery


         V     Based on the documents provided and our inspection, we are of
               the opinion that there is no third party responsible for the
               damages. Thus, there are no chances of any recovery from any
               third party.


8.3     The net assessed loss works out to Rs 5,19,974.00 The detailed
        loss summary is attached to the report as Annexure.
