4.2       The incidence report provided by the Insured has been reproduced
          verbatim without any corrections, if any required to be made, with
          regard to spellings and/or grammar. The copy of Khabar and police
          report is attached with this report.


4.3       The incident was confirmed by inspecting the available CCTV
          footages. The spray dryer has three stage drying, in which the milk

14533- VRS Foods Ltd.                                Kamal Biyani Associates   4
          concentrate is sprayed from the top portion of the dryer along with
          the steam. As the milk concentrate (moisture content-40 to 45%)
          comes downwards, it loses moisture to the hot steam and the finally
          the dairy whitener powder is produced, which has a moisture
          content of 3-5% only. The dryer is erected inside a four storey
          building. The drying is done in three stages i.e. dryer chamber,
          Integrated Fluid Bed Dryer (IFBD) and Fluid Bed Dryer (FBD).


5.0       CAUSE OF LOSS


5.1       The exact cause of fire was not known. The insured also carried out
          internal investigation to ascertain the cause. However, it was
          concluded that the fire which took place inside the dryer was
          accidental. The stock i.e. milk concentrate caught fire and
          damaged the components of dryer.


5.2       Thus, based on the information & our inspection we opine that
          probable cause of loss was accidental fire.


6.0       EXTENT OF DAMAGE


6.1       Post our intimation, we visited the premises on 13th April 2019 and
          inspected the premises. The fire had taken place inside the dryer
          chamber and the flames had come out from top section and
          bottom section. Soot deposition was observed on fourth floor as well
          as ground floor (powder filling section). Most of the items were
          repaired or replaced prior to our visit due to production urgency. The
          damages were observed to below items:




14533- VRS Foods Ltd.                                   Kamal Biyani Associates   5
6.2       Building: As the flames came out from the FBD and the top portion
          of the dryer, the ceiling on the fourth floor and ground floor was
          found burnt with soot deposition. There was soot deposition in
          various sections. Insured was advised to provide painting work
          estimate.


6.3       Plant & Machinery: As mentioned earlier, immediately after the fire,
          the insured started the repair/ replacement work as the breakdown
          of dryer was affecting the production. Even during our visit, the
          replacement work was in process. It was noticed that few milk
          tankers were kept on hold due to breakdown of the dryer. The sieves
          inside the IFBD, FBD and shifter were burnt as the burning material fell
          on it. The exhaust air temperature suddenly increased from 90oC to
          more than 250oC. The same was confirmed on the system chart. As
          the temperature increased various sensors/ measuring devices/
          valves and nozzles connected to the dryer body got affected, as
          the heat was beyond their prescribed working temperature range.
          The side cladding of the boiler had bulged out. Cracks were also
          noticed on the FBD body. The affected items were identified and
          noted down. It is a common practice followed by dairy industry to
          keep spares of critical/ regular replaceable parts in their stores.
          Accordingly, the insured replaced the parts which were available in
          their stores, while the remaining were procured.


6.4       Apart from above items, few other components/ devices were also
          affected. During the fire incident, the power had tripped, due to
          which few components were damaged due to electrical
          breakdown. These were assessed under MBD claim.


6.5       Hence, the liability if exists is limited to the plant & machinery and
          building paint affected by fire/ heat/ soot only.

7.0       INSURED’S CLAIM VIS A VIS ADIMISSIBILITY


7.1       Insured have lodged the claim for damages to building along with
          electrical fittings for Rs. 13,29,859.00. The supporting invoices,
          purchase order and store issue pass were provided to us.


7.2       Insured has taken standard fire and special perils insurance policy
          and the Building and P&M are covered. The date of loss (12.4.2019)
          was within the policy period. The peril (fire) is covered under the
          policy. Thus, the claim is admissible in the policy.


8.0      ASSESSMENT OF LOSS


8.1      Our assessment of loss is based on our inspection & documents
         submitted by the insured. The supporting documents are enclosed
         with the report.


8.2      Following points are crucial from the point of view of assessment of
         loss.


           I     The insured has shared supporting purchase orders, invoices
                 and store issue pass. Most of the spares were available in the
                 stores and hence, these were repaired in-house. Supporting
                 purchase invoices were provided to us. The items which were
                 not available in the stores were procured and their supporting
                 PO and invoices were shared. The assessment is done based on
                 such documents.


         (-)     Depreciation
          II     As the policy has reinstatement value clause and the claimed
                 items were reinstated, depreciation is not applied.



14533- VRS Foods Ltd.                                   Kamal Biyani Associates   7
          (-) Salvage
          III   Most of the items were repaired only few were replaced.
                Insured had not shared any salvage value offer. Hence, we
                have deducted Rs. 5000.00 as likely realizable value against
                P&M. For building no salvage value was deducted as only
                painting work was carried out.


          (-) Underinsurance
          IV    The insured had fixed asset register of the plant. Based on the
                FAR the reinstatement value of building and P&M was worked
                out using indexing. The property was found adequately
                covered. The detailed working is attached with the assessment.


          (-) Excess
          V     The excess as per policy is 5% of claim amount subject to
                minimum of INR 5,00,000.00 as the sum insured is more than 100
                Cr.


8.3      The net assessment of loss is works out to Rs. 162948.00.
         The detailed working is attached as Annexure to the
         report.
         The assessment has been explained to the insured, who has given
         their consent vide mail dated 11th December 2019.

         attached to the Policy issued to & held by the insured.
