3.0      INCIDENT


3.1      It was informed that on 20th February 2019 at around 5.40 am, there
         was leakage in the zinc tank of furnace no - 1640. The leakage of zinc
         was noticed when there was drop in the level of the tank.
         Immediately, the molten zinc present inside the tank was pumped out
         and collected in drums. However, some of the molten zinc had
         already flowed through the flue gas passage and got solidified inside
         it. The incident report provided to us is enclosed with our survey report.


4.0      EXTENT OF DAMAGE


4.1      We have visited the insured premises on 21st February 2019. The
         insured is in the business of manufacturing of wire ropes. One of the
         stages in the manufacturing is galvanizing of wire. They have installed
         few lines of continuous galvanizing. The line mainly constituted of
         precleaing, dipping in molten zinc, cooling and winding. Zinc tank of
         one of the galvanizing line was found leaking/punctured.
         At the time of our visit, the line was stopped and the zinc was
         pumped out of the tank. The pumped out quantity was kept in thirty-
         nine drums. The weight of this recovered quantity was around 33.44
         MT. It was observed that some of the material was contaminated. It
         was informed that, the contaminated material would not be reused.
         Rest of the material will be reused.
         During the survey, process of removal of the leaked out material from
         the flue gas passage was underway. It was informed that, final weight
         of this collected quantity will be known once all the material from
         passage and refractory portion below the tank is collected.

         It was informed that the tank will be removed and inspected to find
         out the exact source of leakage and the reason for the same. During
         our visit, the refractory material was being removed in order to
         remove the tank.


4.2      We advised the following line of action to the insured:


            1. Kindly provide weighment details as under…
                a. Weight of total material recovered (inside drums and also
                    the strips)
                b. Weight of material which can be used from the recovered
                    material
                c. Weight of material which is contaminated and not usable
                d. Weight of material which is lost/ not traceable (Total weight
                    – weight of material which is recovered)
            2. We request you to provide your observations/ report once the
                tank is inspected and damages are identified.
            3. To provide communication exchanged with the supplier of the
                tank with respect to the reported damages.
            4. To undertake the Root Cause Analysis report about the failure


4.3      Subsequently, the tank was removed. Hole was observed inside the
         tank, which was repaired (by welding) and tank was commissioned.
         Thereafter, we again visited the plant on 11th March 2019 and
         gathered following details about the Zinc recovery…

5.0      INSURED CLAIM


5.1      Insured had provided loss estimate of Rs 42.15 lacs.


6.0      CAUSE OF DAMAGE VIS-À-VIS ADMISSIBILITY


6.1      The tank was stationary and subjected to continuous heat. The cause
         of failure to the tank was gradual deterioration / wear and tear /
         effect of continual use. The subject cause is specifically excluded
         (exclusion 1-a-i) under Industrial All Risk Policy. Excerpt from the policy
         is quoted below.
         Quote
         1) This policy does not cover damage to the property insured caused
         by: a) i) faulty or defective design materials or workmanship inherent
         vice latent defect gradual deterioration deformation or distortion or
         wear and tear
         Unquote
         Thus the claim is not admissible.


6.2      We apprised the insured about the claim vide mail dated 1st July 2019
         and requested to write back if they have any alternate opinion with
         supporting documents. Till date there is not revert. Thus we are closing
         our file as “No Claim”.


7.0      TENTATIVE ASSESSMENT OF LOSS


7.1      We have worked out tentative assessment of loss basis on of our
         inspection and the documents submitted by the Insured. Per Metric
         Ton rate of the zinc was considered from Tax Inv. AM/1166/2018-19
         dtd 18th February 2019 of Amex Resource. Tank related expenses viz.
         Refractory repair Cost, Maintenance Repair Cost including mobile
         cranes for handling and Tank repair cost were considered as per the
         estimate. Gross Loss works out to Rs 13.51 lakh.

Bharat Wi r e R op e s – 1 43 91 /ICICI/1819     Kam al Bi yani A ss o ciat es   5
7.2      The cause of failure to the tank was gradual deterioration / wear and
         tear / effect of continual use. Thus, tank related expenses attract
         depreciation, since their life is over.


7.3      Based on the above documents, the loss has been assessed to Rs.
         651000.00 as per assessment sheet attached. Since policy has excess
         clause i.e. 5% of claim amount subject to minimum of Rs.10 lacs,
         assessed loss comes to below excess. Since loss comes to below
         excess, under-Insurance working is not carried out.


8.0      CONCLUSION


8.1      The cause of failure to the tank was gradual deterioration / wear and
         tear / effect of continual use. Thus the claim is not admissible.
         Moreover, it falls below excess. Therefore, we are closing our file as
         “No Claim”.
