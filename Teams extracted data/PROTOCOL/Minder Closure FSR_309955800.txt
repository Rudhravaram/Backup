NATURE AND EXTENT OF DAMAGE          :
During our survey Mr. Hile conducted us & narrated the incident. The insured is in the
business of manufacturing/ production of various food items such as farsan, gram
flour etc. The incident narrated to us and the written statement given by the insured
stated that, the oil in the frying pan/kadhai suddenly caught fire and the fire then
spread across the electrical wiring. The fire through exhaust fan reached on the rear
side of the kitchen wall where the heap of wood blocks was kept. Also, 150 oil cans


  Minder Food-14348/ICICI/18-19                                                P a g e 2|4
which were reportedly delivered in the afternoon were placed at the rear side (by
the blocks out in the open). In the fire these oil cans and wood blocks got damaged.
This incident took place on 25th January 2019 at around 7 p. m. The copy of incident
report (which is in vernacular) given by the insured during the survey is enclosed with
the report.


The premises were thoroughly inspected. At the time of our survey, none of the cans
were available for inspection. Upon enquiry insured informed us that these 150
reportedly burnt cans were handed over to the scrap buyer on 28th January 2019. No
photographic evidence was shown to us. Also the reportedly damaged wiring was
already replaced and the exhaust fan was sent for repairs prior to our visit. Hence,
the opportunity to inspect/ confirm the damages was not given to us. Later on, in the
evening, Mr. Hile called us on the phone and informed us that there was a fight
between the employees and during which the wooden blocks/oil cans were
reportedly set on fire by them. The exact circumstances leading to the loss were not
clear and also, the reportedly damaged quantity was not preserved for our
inspection.


In view of the same, we are not in the position to certify the reported damages as
claimed by the insured. Our observations were conveyed to the insured vide mail
and registered AD dated 30th Jan 2019. Till date, we have not received any response
from the insured on the same. Accordingly, we are closing our file as NO CLAIM.


REASON FOR CLOSURE


As elaborated earlier, no opportunity to inspect the damages were given to us.
Further, it was also informed that there was a fight between the employees and
during which the wooden blocks/oil cans were reportedly set on fire by them. The
written incident & verbal information was not corroborating. Thus, the circumstances
leading to loss is also not clear. Further, the policy covers only finished stock. The
