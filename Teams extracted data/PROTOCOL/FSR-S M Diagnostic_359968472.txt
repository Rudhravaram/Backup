3.0    INCIDENT


3.1    It is a matter of common knowledge that Kolhapur, Sangli, Satara and
       adjoining cities in Western Maharashtra were flooded due to incessant
       torrential monsoon rains from 4th August 2019 onwards. The incident was
       covered by various news channels and print media across the nation.
       Insured’s diagnostic center was also flooded in the incident reportedly
       on 5th /6th August 2019. The inundation continued till 12/13th August 2019.

       inundation level was clearly visible inside the insured’s premises. All the
       machines were affected as the level was around 4 feet.


3.3    The insured has shared photographs snapped by them. The severity of
       floods and the water level is evident in the same.

                                                             P a g e 3 | 10
4.0   CAUSE OF DAMAGE


4.1   Heavy rains poured in Maharastra (Kolhapur, Sangali, Karad, Belgam,
      Ichalkarancji, Satara, Hatkarangale, Meraj etc), Karnataka, Kerala &
      other states from 26th July 2019 to 12th August 2019. Due to this floods had
      occurred in various region. The incidence is well reported in TV and print
      media all over the country. Due to this, water logged at insured’s named
      location.


4.2   Thus, based on our observations and information provided to us, the
      cause of loss could reasonably attributed to flood.


5.0   OUR OBSERVATIONS & EXTENT OF DAMAGES


►     About The Insured


5.1   The insured’s farm is a diagnostic clinic in the name of “S M Diagnostic
      and research center” in Kolhapur which carry out different tests such as
      MRI, CT scan, sonography, X ray, mammography etc. It is one of the
      leading diagnostic center in the region.


►     Description of The Risk


5.2   The risk was situated at Assembly Road, Near Basant Bahar Talkies,
      Kolhapur- Maharashtra -416001. The building was multistoried RCC
      structure with pane walls of the bricks and roof of RCC. The center is
      located on the ground floor of the building. The plinth height was around
      3 to 4 feet. It was occupied as diagnostic and research center. Inside the
      center, there were separate rooms for different equipment.




                                                            P a g e 4 | 10
►     Extent of damages


5.3   We carried out the survey at the affected location on 15th August 2019
      and subsequently thereafter. At the time of our survey, the water had
      already receded from the premises. The premises were thoroughly
      inspected and photographed.          The entire contents such as FFF,
      machinery, was submerged in the flood water. The inundation level was
      clearly visible inside the insured’s premises. All the machines were almost
      submerged completely as the level was around 3 to 4 feet. Insured was
      advised to clean the premises and get all the machines inspected by the
      respective agencies & provide their reports. Broadly following machines
      were found submerged fully/partially…
         1. MRI with all accessories
         2. CT with all accessories
         3. CR system & film printer
         4. Generator with amf pannel
         5. Network devices
         6. Sonography machine
         7. X-ray machine
         8. Printers
         9. Various office equipment


5.4   MRI and CT were the costliest equipment, wherein around 95% of total
      value was involved. These equipment were inspected thoroughly. The
      engineers of the suppliers were also called, to facilitate the joint
      inspection. Brief details are as under…


   MRI (Magenetic Resonance Imaging)
      It is highly sophisticated medical equipment. The equipment was Siemens
      make (Model: Magnetom Avanto, 1.5 Tesla, Sr. No. 27870). The gantry
      was under water. The major electronic as well as electrical systems were


                                                           P a g e 5 | 10
  under contaminated water for more than 5 days. Thus, these systems are
  bound to be affected. The equipment has to be generally under
  controlled atmosphere. However, due to electricity stoppages, it
  remained under extreme and unstable atmosphere for considerable
  period. This obviously had affected the reliability quotient of entire
  system. Nevertheless, Siemens engineers had prepared the list of the
  visually affected parts. Though some of the parts such as controllers,
  transformer, drives etc. were field replaceable, many of the affected
  parts such as backplane racks, internal wiring, magnets, RF cabin parts
  were not field replaceable. This list of the affected items was prepared
  by Siemens on the basis of the visual inspection. For further inspection, the
  system needed to be powered on. However, due to safety aspect, the
  powering on was completely ruled out. The supplier had provided us the
  repair quotation amounting to Rs.4,48,00,000.00 based on the external
  inspection. However, they had refused to give any guarantee of the
  performance due to reliability loss. Thus, the repairs were not feasible
  technically as well as economically and hence the equipment was
  treated as constructive total loss.


 CT Scanner (computerized tomography)
  It is also equally sophisticated medical equipment. The equipment was
  GE make. The patient table was under water. The major electronic as well
  as electrical systems were under contaminated water for more than 5
  days. Thus, these systems are bound to be affected. The equipment
  consists of following units….
        Scanner Unit
        Patient Table
        PDU Unit
        Operator’s Console
  The scanner unit houses major assemblies such as X ray tube, High
  Voltage generators, many image processing printed circuit boards,


                                                        P a g e 6 | 10
      power supplies, detector unit, and many preamplifiers. The flood water
      had entered inside these critical assemblies and has physically damaged
      these sensitive electronic components. This equipment has to be
      generally under controlled atmosphere. However, due to electricity
      stoppages, it remained under extreme and unstable atmosphere for
      considerable period. This obviously had affected the reliability quotient
      of entire system. Nevertheless, maintenance engineers had prepared the
      list of the visually affected parts. For further inspection, the system needed
      to be powered on. However, due to safety aspect, the powering on was
      completely ruled out. The engineer had provided us the repair quotation
      amounting to Rs.2,24,00,000.00 based on the external inspection.
      However, they had refused to give any guarantee of the performance
      due to reliability loss. Thus, the repairs were not feasible technically as well
      as economically and hence the equipment was treated as constructive
      total loss.

7.0   ASSESSMENT OF LOSS


7.1   Our assessment of loss is based on our inspection & documents submitted
      by the Insured. The supporting documents are enclosed with the report.


7.2   Following points are crucial from the assessment of loss point of view:


►     Plant and Machinery


7.3   Out of damaged items loss to MRI machine and CT scan machine is only
      considered. Policy has RIV clause. Other damaged items were not
      reinstated; hence as per policy, these were not considered.
      Insured have provided few supporting documents. We have relied on
      these documents …
            Tax   invoice   MH3927002552    dated    28.09.2019     of     Siemens
             Healthineers for replacement of MRI machine ( Magnetom spectra
             +RF cabin)
            Purchase order raised to Siemens Healthcare Pvt Ltd dated
             24/09/2019 for replacement of CT scan.


7.4   The reinstated items were of higher specification. Hence, we have
      deducted 35% towards upgradation.


(-)   Salvage:


      Initially supplier have given salvage value offer of Rs. 35 lacs, through
      insured. We advised insured to explore the possibility of cannibalizing the
      parts to some third party service providers of similar equipment. After
      hectic negotitation, Insured agreed for deduction of Rs 9,250,000.00 on
      account of salvage value. Hence we have deducted Rs. 9,250,000.00 on
      the account of salvage value.


                                                           P a g e 8 | 10
(-)    Underinsurance:


       The total value for plant and machinery as on date of loss works out as
       Rs. 67,419,125.01/- The sum insured is Rs. 52,500,000.00. Thus, there is
       underinsurance of 22.13%. Hence amount of Rs. 9,125,441.84 is deducted
       on account of underinsurance.


(-)    Excess:
       As per policy 5% of claim amount sub to min of Rs. 10,000/- is deducted.


7.4    The assessment of loss works out to Rs. 30,504,665.53. The
       detailed assessment is attached as Annexure to the report.
       The assessment has been explained to the Insured, who have given their
       consent.


8.0    WARRANTIES


8.1    We have not observed any breach of general or specific warranties
       attached to the policy issued to & held by the Insured.


9.0    CONCLUSIONS


9.1    The cause of loss is flood/inundation, the peril that is covered under the
       scope of policy issued to & held by the Insured. Thus, the claim falls within
       the purview of the policy & is tenable.


10.0   This report is issued without prejudice & subject to the terms, conditions
       and warranties to the policy issued to & held by the insured.
