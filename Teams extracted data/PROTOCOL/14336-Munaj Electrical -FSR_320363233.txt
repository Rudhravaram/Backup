4.1       During our visit, Mr. Sher khan Shaikh conducted us & narrated the
          incident. The supporting incident narration was provided to us. The gist
          of same is elaborated here…
          (Quote)
4.2       On 22nd January 2019 we kept all our things at the godown & closed
          our godown at around 9 p.m. at around 1.45 a.m. we heard some
          noise. Our neighbors woke up us. We immediately rushed towards our
          godown & there was fire in the godown. We tried to extinguish the fire
          with the help of our neighbors. The fire was under control hence fire
          brigade team was not called. Police authority were informed about the
          incidence. The fire was due to short circuit in the electric board.
          (Unquote)


4.3       The incident report provided by the insured is in vernacular. However,
          we have translated the same giving the gist of the incidence narrated

          documents the cause of loss mentioned as accidental fire. The
          supporting police documents are attached with the report.

8.0       ASSESSMENT OF LOSS


8.1       Our assessment of loss is based on our inspection & documents
          submitted by the Insured.         As the policy covers only stock; the
          assessment is done towards stock only. The supporting documents are
          attached to the report.


8.2       Following points are crucial from the assessment of loss point of view:


            I    We have assessed the loss based on the physical inspection/
                 quantification carried out by us during visit. Supporting purchase
                 invoices were forwarded by the insured but same were un-signed
                 (copy attached with assessment sheet). The unit rate is considered
                 based on such Invoices. However, since Invoices were not proper,
                 hence we have deducted 10% towards rate variance, the
                 detailed working is attached as Annexure I to the report.


           (-)   Depreciation
            II   Not applicable being stock


           (-)   Salvage
           III   The affected material was not fit for its intended use. Still, we have
                 reasonably deducted 10% as salvage value for the damaged
                 items.

           (-)   Underinsurance:
           IV    As per verbal Information by Insured the entire stock was around
                 to Rs.10,00,000/-. The sum insured towards stock is Rs.25,00,000/-
                 Thus,   the   stock   is   adequately   covered      &   there   is   no
                 underinsurance.


           (-)   Excess:
           V     Excess as per policy is 5% of claim amount with subject to min of
                 Rs. 10,000/-, accordingly Rs. 10000/- is deducted.


8.3       The tentative assessed loss works out to Rs. 41,241.00. The
          detailed assessment is attached as Annexure/s to the report.


          Our assessment has been shared with the insured who have given their
          written consent on 31st March 2019. The written consent is enclosed with
          the report.


9.0       WARRANTIES


9.1       We have not observed any breach of general or specific warranties
          attached to the Policy issued to & held by the Insured.


10.0      CONCLUSIONS


10.1      The cause of loss was accidental fire caused due to short-circuit, the
          peril that is covered under the scope of policy issued to & held by the
          Insured. Thus, the claim falls within the purview of the policy & is
