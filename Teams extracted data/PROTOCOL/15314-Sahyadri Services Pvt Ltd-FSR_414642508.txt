3.0   INCIDENT


3.1   During our visit the owner of Petrol pump-Mr. Prashant Suke conducted us and
      narrated the incident. Thereafter written statement was also provided to us
      which is as under…
      (QUOTE)
      “On 25th September 2019 at 10.32 pm due to heavy rain, water accumulated
      to surrounding premises (around 3 ft) & the nalaha which was adjoining to our
      petrol pump was also flooded. Flood water impressed into petrol & diesel tanks
      through dipstick, flange, motor area. There were total three tanks available at
      petrol pump.
      1. Tank No-1-Diesel
      2. Tank No 2- Diesel
      3. Tank No MS-3-Petrol
      Water was accumulated in the premises for around 8 hours from night 10.32
      pm to early morning 6.00 am. Due to this, all petrol (Tank No MS -3) & Diesel
      (Tank No-1 & Tank No 2-) got mixed with flood water. On next day morning,
      authorized team from Bharat Petroleum came to premises and have cleaned
      all three tanks. They have informed us that due to high density water remained
      at down and petrol/diesel came on upper level. Contaminated diesel and
      petrol were drained out by them. The damaged quantity of diesel and petrol
      was decided by deducting sale quantity from total quantity with the help of
      daily record book. Talathi panchnama was carried out by next day. On next
      day, we inform our Banker (Prena Bank) Manager about this situation and
      losses. but the Bank Manager did not inform me about the Insurance policy of
      Petrol Pump. And hence we did not claim a pass out on that date. In the


                                                                   Page 3|8
      month of Feb 20, we received a message from the bank for Insurance renewal
      of petrol pump. That time we have asked the manager about our Sept 2019
      losses and claim. That time the Bank Manager suggested lodging the claim
      complaint so we raised a complaint.”
      (UNQUOTE)


3.2   We have reproduced the gist of the narration given by the insured. The original
      narration (in vernacular) given by the insured is enclosed with the report.
      Insured has also shared few photographs and videos in support of the incident.


4.0   CAUSE OF LOSS


4.1   As there was delay in intimating the loss, the opportunity to inspect the site was
      not given. At the time of our inspection, we have verified the stock register. It
      was reported that on next day i.e. on 26th September 2019 @ 9.00 am all
      activities such as Switching off the MSEB electrical supply, removing of
      mud/flood water, draining out the contaminated diesel and petrol was
      reportedly carried out in presence of Tahsildar, Bhor, BPCL sales officer Mr.
      Bhanupratap Singh and Bharat petroleum team. In support of the claim,
      insured have provided us Talathi panchnama, photographs at the time of loss,
      inspection report from Bharat petroleum, photographs during cleaning etc.


4.2   Thus, solely based on the information and documents provided by the insured
      in support of their claim, the cause of loss can most reasonably attributed to
      flood/ inundation.


5.0   Nature & Extent of Damages


5.1   As elaborated above, loss was intimated after almost 5 months. We have
      carried out survey on 22nd February 20202. All tanks were reportedly cleaned
      and all material drained out by Bharat petroleum authorized agency after
      next day of incidence. Reported damages could not be witnessed by us as

                                                                     Page 4|8
      there was delay. Hence we had to rely on the documentary evidence to
      ascertain the loss. At the time of our inspection, we have verified the contents
      of the stock register. Insured have provided us photographs and video
      footage taken at the time of loss. Water was accumulated in the premises for
      around 8 hours from night 10.32 pm to early morning 6.00 am. Due to this, flood
      water ingressed into petrol & diesel tanks through dipstick, flange and motor
      area & the water got mixed with petrol and diesel present inside the tank.
      Quantification is as under.
         1. Diesel- Tank No-1 -5623 ltr
         2. Diesel -Tank No 2- 8306 ltr
         3. Petrol-Tank No MS -3 -4916 ltr
      Insured have lodged the complaint to Talathi and provided us Talathi
      Panchnama. We had advised Insured to provide us internal communication
      with Bharat petroleum for confirmation of inspection, photographs during
      draining activity and visit report of Bharat Petroleum so that the occurrence of
      the incident and post loss activities can be confirmed.


5.2   Thereafter Insured have provided us claim estimate with supporting
      documents. Also Insured have provided us photographs during cleaning
      activity and inspection report from Bharat petroleum.


5.3   Along with stock of petrol and diesel, generator was also reportedly got
      damaged in the subject flood loss. However as per the policy only stock is
      covered. In our opinion, if the loss was intimated timely, chances of retrieval of
      stock could have been possible. Hence, while assessing the loss, we have
      taken into consideration the delay factor. The liability if any limited to allowed
      stock of damaged petrol and diesel only.




                                                                     Page 5|8

7.0   ASSESSMENT OF LOSS


7.1   Our assessment of loss is based on our inspection & documents submitted by
      the Insured. The supporting documents are enclosed with the report. Following
      points are crucial from the assessment of loss point of view.


7.2   Insured has provided statement of stock book record from the month of June
      2019 up to date of loss (25th September 2019). Opening stock and closing stock
      on daily basis was maintained in these records. These records were thoroughly
      checked by us. Quantity claimed by Insured is ascertained with the help of

                                                                      Page 6|8

      these invoices.


7.3   Net allowance:
      There was delay of 5 months in intimating the flood loss. In our opinion if the
      loss was intimated timely, chances of retrieval of stock could have been
      possible. During our meetings with Insured, we had highlighted our concerns
      regarding this. Keeping this aspect ahead, we have allowed only 40% value
      of gross amount reasonably and Insured has agreed on the same.

      balance sheet stock as on date of loss Rs. 13,58,290.00. Sum insured availed
      for the stock is Rs. 25,00,000.00. Thus, stock is adequately covered and there is
      no underinsurance as such.
