3.0    INCIDENT


3.1    It was well known that Kolhapur, Sangli, Satara and adjoining cities in
       Western Maharashtra were flooded due to incessant torrential monsoon
       rains from 4th August 2019 onwards. Insured’s premises was also flooded

       inside    the   premises    &       14    ft.   outside     the   premises    due    to
       Flooding/inundation.       Entire        stocks    were      submerged       into   the
       muddy/contaminated water for 4-5 days. The stagnated flood water
       receded on 16th August 2019.

      Contents/FFF : The FFF such as Tables and chairs, Racks etc., found
       with water marks completely affected with flooded water. The

       submerged over 5ft under the water, the total water level was
       around 12 ft. The sludge was heavy deposited over the PC. Being
       electronic high tech machine repair not possible. Even by visual
       inspection it is beyond repair. The Machine was completely under
       water from 5th August to 15th August 2019 due to severe flood at
       Sangli.


Further, insured were requested to provide technical report for the same.
We have received mail form the repairer. It states as under…


Quote:-
“The Mechanical movement part Like Linear motio Rail, Y Motor are
completely due to rust.
2) Power Supply unit is completely damaged as it is merged in water.
3) The Negative Pressure Control system was damaged and the reservor

      6) The Feed Movement for the X-Axis was damaged including the Pinch
      rollers and the X-Axis Motor.
      7) As all the 8 heads under water the Nozzles will be damaged.
      8) All the Ink feeding System and the degas system is damaged.


      My Observation and Action to bring the machine into working condition.
      1) We need to completely Clean the machine Part by part. Which Will
      Take minimum 3/4 days.
      2) We need to Clean the Electronics Board and Power Supply and need
      to be installed the new one. As we can't take the chance.
      3) The Carriage Motion system was completely rusted. The Linear Motion
      Rail can't be replaced at customer site. If it can't be cleaned then the
      movement will be possible.
      4) The Y Motor , X Motor, Encoder Scale, Encoder Sensor, Driving Pulley
      and the Idle Pulley need to be replaced,
      5) The Vacuum zone unit need to be opened and cleaned.
      6) After replacing all the parts we need to power ON and then need to
      check the head status.
      In My opinion to bring the machine into working condition the cost will be
      more than cost of a new Machine. Labour required to bring the machine
      into working condition will be around 10 Days with all the parts available.”

      Thus, the machine was treated as TOTAL LOSS.
