                                                    due to electrical short circuit in the shop
                                                    No 23 – Brand mart.

 (COVERAGE FOR PROPERTY AND
 MAIN PERIL OPERATION)
                                                                                     Page 1|2
RELEVANT POLICY CONDITIONS,           : As per policy
WARRANTIES
LOSS INDEMNIFIABLE UNDER POLICY       : Yes. We had also discussed about the
TERMS? (REVIEW OF APPLICABLE            possible recovery option from the
POLICY TERMS AND COMMENT)               Brandmart. We had advised insured to
                                        protect the recovery rights. As confirmed
                                        by the insured, the Brandmart was not
                                        having any insurance policy.
NATURE AND EXTENT OF DAMAGE           : The fire had originated in the shop by
                                        name – Brandmart located on first floor.
                                        The fire spread further in the passage. The
                                        electrical, ducting, POP etc. got burnt. The
                                        soot generated got spread all over the
                                        mall. Due to closed structure (centralized
                                        AC), the soot travelled upto top floor. The
                                        water used in firefighting also added to
                                        the damages. The preliminary listing of the
                                        damages is enclosed with the report.
                                        Further, detailed extent of damages is
                                        being evaluated.
POLICY LIABILITY                      : Yes. This is subject to findings of the
                                        investigation regarding cause of fire.
INSURED'S ESTIMATE OF LOSS            : Rs. 83,00,000/-
PRESENTLY ESTIMATED LOSS RESERVE      : At this stage, we had recommended
                                        reserves of Rs. 45,00,000/-

                                        the some of the assets damaged, the

                                        payment.
