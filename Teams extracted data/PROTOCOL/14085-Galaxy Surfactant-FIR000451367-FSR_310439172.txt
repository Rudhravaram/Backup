4.0      EXTENT OF DAMAGE


4.1      During our survey we have inspected blower of following name
         plate details…


         Make                                    :   Aerzen
         Model                                   :   AT 200 0.8 S
         Serial Number                           :   P - 15080415


4.2      It was already removed from the place of installation and kept
         aside. During our survey, it was powered on (dry run). The jamming
         was confirmed. However, the exact extent of damages could not
         be confirmed, as the service person of the supplier was not
         available. We again visited the premises along with the service
         person of the supplier. The symptoms were confirmed. The blower
         was found jammed. In addition, its driving motor was also found
         damaged. It was completely integrated assembly and was
         imported. The necessary infrastructure to repair the equipment was
         not available in India. Considering the nature of the damages, the
         supplier also ruled out repairs even at their overseas manufacturing
         location at China. Hence the equipment was treated as total loss.


5.0      CAUSE OF DAMAGE


5.1      The breakdown took place suddenly. The error logs were sent to
         supplier for their analysis. As per their feedback, the errors 224,225,
         210 gets logged multiple times. This was co-related to power dips in
         the incoming power condition. The most probable cause of failure
         was fluctuations in the supply power. The cause is not excluded
         under the policy issued to and held by the insured. Thus the claim is
         admissible under the policy.
