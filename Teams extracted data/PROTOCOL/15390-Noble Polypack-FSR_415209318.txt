4.0   Nature & Extent of Damages


4.1   Post our intimation we contacted the insured for arranging the visit.
      Accordingly, on 17th May 2020, we visited the premises for the inspection.
      The insured Mr Santosh Kothari could not come due to lockdown, however,
      his employees conducted us around and narrated the incident.


4.2   About the insured:
      The insured manufactures various types of packing material related to
      industrial (box strapping, bubble wrap, foam sheet etc.) and food industry
      supply. Majorly they supply printed plastic pouches for grapes which are for
      export purposes. They have various types of extruders and moulding
      machine for this purpose. The assets were hypothecated to the
      Vishweshwar Sahakari Bank Ltd., Chakan.


4.3   Description of risk:
      The plot along with the civil structure was purchased by the insured two
      years back. The total plot area is around 900 sq. meters and the build-up
      area is around 5060 sq. feet. There are two main blocks, one is the office
      building of RCC construction having area of 1130 sq. feet and factory shed
      which is having walls of burnt bricks with roof of asbestos sheets laid on MS
      frame work. The area of factory shed is around 5060 sq. feet.


4.4   Observations:
      It was observed that the premises was cleaned and the water was removed
      from the premises prior to our visit. The stock (bags kept in upper layers) were
      moved from ground and kept on mezzanine floor. The water level was
      clearly visible on the walls and it was around 4-5 inches. The insured has
      shared videos and photographs taken after the incident, which confirm
      occurrence of the said incident. Following items were affected in the

                                                                Page 3|9
      incident:
            Building
            Stock


4.5   Building:
      The asbestos sheets and polycarbonate sheets were damaged (cracked
      and broken) at few places while at few places these were displaced and
      gap was observed in the roof. The rain water gutter/ channel was also found
      affected. Hence, few sheets needed replacement and few sheets needed
      to refitted. Insured was advised to provide the quotation for the same. The
      insured has submitted the quotation which is found reasonable and hence
      considered.


4.6   Apart from the roof, the insured had also claimed for the floor paint. Insured
      was of opinion that the flooring paint work was damaged due to water &
      mud inundation and needed to be repainted. We had thoroughly
      inspected the entire floor area and we had not found any damages akin to
      the subject incident. Furthermore, scratches and undulations were
      observed on the floor which were due to ageing/ wear. Hence, the
      damages were not due to the reported incident. Our observations were
      conveyed to the insured on mail as well as during joint meeting along with
      the insured’s bankers on 19th June 2020. Hence, the damages to the flooring
      were not considered.


4.7   Stocks:
      The stock of FG, WIP and raw material was affected in the incident which
      was kept on the floor. The plastic pouches (for grapes) were kept in bundles
      inside PP bags (each bag contained around 2500 pouches). The RM such
      as LDPE, HDPE and colors were also placed in PP bags. The bags were found
      with mud marks and water was seen on them. After opening the bag, inside
      pouches were also found with water and mud traces on it. The bubble wrap
      rolls were also partially submerged in water. The plastic granules were also

                                                               Page 4|9
      partially submerged under water. As informed, the bags kept in bottom
      layers were only kept at ground floor, while the remaining bags were shifted
      to the mezzanine floor after the incident. These bags were found in sound
      condition. The bags kept in ground floor were quantified and jointly
      recorded. We had advised the insured to provide the costing details of the
      items affected.


4.8   The insured did not claim for the raw material which was affected in the
      incident and informed us that these will be used for production. However,
      the insured put the entire FG stock of pouches under the claim stating that
      these were food grade products and were contaminated in the reported
      incident. As the water level was only 4-5 inches (as confirmed from the
      photographs and marks on wall) we were not in agreement with the
      insured’s statement. The bottom layer bags were only submerged under the
      water. The quantity was jointly taken during our initial visit itself. Various
      discussions were held with the insured over mail, telephonic as well as during
      our meeting with the bankers at the insured’s plant. Our observations
      regarding the quantity were conveyed to the insured. It was finally agreed
      that the quantity which was quantified will be considered plus reasonable
      allowance towards loss during shifting of material will be allowed.


4.9   The FG stock of plastic pouches (black, red, general and pink) used for
      grapes packing was found affected by the muddy water and was not fit for
      the use. Other packing items such as great healthy bags and bubble sheet
      rolls were also contaminated. The insured had also claimed for the slider
      and zipper (WIP) which were kept near the machines. We had only seen the
      sliders and zippers were not shown to us hence, we have only considered
      the quantity of sliders.


5.0   ASSESSMENT OF LOSS




                                                               Page 5|9
5.1   The assessment is done based on the documents submitted by the insured.
      These documents are enclosed with the report. Our assessment is subject to
      the policy terms and conditions. Following points are crucial from the
      assessment perspective…


5.2   Stock:
      The insured had claimed for the entire quantity of FG and WIP. We have
      considered the quantity based on our inspection. In support of the rate, the
      insured had submitted sale invoices. The manufacturing cost was not
      provided to us. Hence, we had taken the average GP from the past three
      balance sheet & profit and loss statements (FY: 2016-17, 2017-18 & 2018-19)
      and deducted the profit component from the selling price in order to arrive
      at the manufacturing cost. Please refer annexure I of the assessment sheet
      for detailed working.
              Depreciation: Not applicable on stocks
              Salvage: The insured had given the offer of Rs. 68100.00 for the entire
               lot. We have proportionately considered the salvage value based on
               the quantity which was allowed by us and the claimed quantity. The
               amount of Rs. 20665.24 was deducted towards salvage. This value
               was also found to be in range with the prevailing market rate for
               plastic pouches/ material.
              Underinsurance: The total stock was physically quantified during initial
               visit itself. The insured had provided the total stock details.
               Accordingly, after deducting the GP from the FG stock value, the
               total stock (RM+WIP+FG) came to Rs. 31,14,455.00 while the sum
               insured for stocks is Rs. 40,00,000.00. Hence the stock is adequately
               covered.
      Please refer annexure I for detailed working.


5.3   Building:




                                                                  Page 6|9
      The insured had submitted the quotations in support of their building claim.
      The assessment is done based on the same. The floor paint work was
      disallowed as it was not damaged in the incident.
            Depreciation: The exact age/ year of construction was not known,
             hence, lum sum 10% is deducted towards depreciation.
            Salvage: The damaged asbestos sheets and polycarbonate sheets
             would not realize any salvage value and most of the sheets were
             being refitted. Hence, no deductions were made towards salvage.
            Underinsurance: The bankers had provided copy of index II and
             valuation report (cover pages). Based on the same, the area for
             office section and factory shed was taken and reinstatement value
             was calculated by applying the unit rate of construction based on
             the type of construction. Further, the RIV was depreciated to arrive at
             the market value of Rs. 38,73,150.00, while the sum insured is Rs.
             48,60,000.00. Hence, the building is adequately covered.
      Please refer annexure II for detailed working.


5.4   Excess: The excess as per policy is 5% of claim amount subject to minimum
      of INR 10,000.00. Accordingly, the value of Rs. 22698.93 is deducted.


5.5   The assessment of loss works out to Rs. 4,31,280.00. The detailed
      assessment is attached as Annexure I & II to the report.


      The assessment is explained to the insured & insured have given consent for
      the same vide mail dated 27th July 2020.
