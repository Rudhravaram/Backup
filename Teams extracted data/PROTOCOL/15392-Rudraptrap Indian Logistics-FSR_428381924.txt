        Pvt. Ltd for reported loss/damage to their property due to reported storm
                       insured under Standard Fire & Special Perils Policy

    1.0      INTRODUCTION


    1.1      Rudrapratap Indian Logistics Pune Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai lodged a claim
             on account of a reported storm against loss/ damage to their
             property, on their insurer, ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co. Ltd.,

    1.2      Insurer’s appointed us on 16th May 2020 to carry out the survey and to
             issue the final survey report.


    1.3      Our basic terms of reference were ...


               a)     To investigate into the circumstances leading to reported loss/
                      damage.

 1.4      Pursuant to above instructions, we visited the insured’s premises
          situated at Rudrapratap Indian Logistics Pune Pvt. Ltd., Bldg. A, Gat
          no: 314, 316-234, Village Yelawadi, Taluka Khed, Dist. Pune,
          Maharashtra on 17th May 2020. The entire premises was inspected and
          photographed. In continuation, the insured was requested to submit
          to us the relevant claim papers in support of the claim vide email
          dated 19th May 2020. This was further followed-up by various
          reminders, however no documents were received in support of the
          claim. Thereafter, on 3rd June 2020, there were additional damages to
          the insured’s property due to cyclone. The insured intimated the same
          to the insurers vide mail dated 5th June 2020. After various reminders,
          the insured vide mail dated 20th June 2020 submitted us a quotation
          for reinstating the damages. A joint visit along with the repairer was
          arranged on 1st July 2020 to confirm the damages.


 1.5      Various discrepancies were noticed in the insured’s quotations as
          compared to the actual damages at the site. These discrepancies
          were highlighted to the insured vide mail dated 1st July 2020 & the
          actual damaged quantity (based on our inspection/ measurement)
          was also conveyed. Thereafter, as we did not receive any revert from
          the insured on our observations, we shared the assessment to them
          vide mail dated 14th July 2020. The insured was not in agreement with
          the working, however, they did not provide any revert on mail & only
          verbal disagreement was conveyed. The insured vide mail dated 12th
          August 2020 provided the revised quotations. The new quotations
          were       completely          different       from      the    initial   quotations.      These
          differences were not comprehensible. Nevertheless, being a claim
          arising out of natural cause, in consultation with the insurers, a more
          liberal assessment was shared with the insured vide mail dated 19th
          August 2020, ignoring the incomprehensible/unacceptable revisions
          in the new quotation. However, no revert was provided by the insured
          on the revised working as well. Telephonic discussions were held with

R ud rap rat ap I n di an L ogi st i cs - 1 53 92 /I C I CI /2 0 - 2 1   K am al Bi yan i As s oci at es   2
          the insured & their agents, during which the insured conveyed their
          disagreement on the revised working as well.


 1.6      The major disagreement was in the quantity of colour coated sheets.
          It should also be noted that till date of issuance of this report, the
          insured had not started the reinstatement work. As the claim was
          pending for long time & the insured was not in agreement with
          assessed amount, the insurers advised us to release the report along
          with the assessment (without considering the reported damages to
          colour coated sheets) & the insured will have to start the
          reinstatement activity & establish the claimed damages to the colour
          coated sheets. After the reinstatement, the final assessment for the
          colour coated sheets will be done. This was verbally discussed with
          the insured & also explained in detail vide mail dated 12 th September
          2020. The insured vide mail dated 22nd September 2020 stated that
          their vendor missed out the damages of glass panels in warehouse A
          of 3200 sq. ft. (Rs. 12,80,000.00) and requested to add the same in the
          assessment. The insured’s claim for reportedly missed out quantity of
          glass panels of warehouse A was not justifiable as we had physically
          measured the damaged area & accordingly assessed the quantity.
          Hence, as advised by the insurers, we are issuing are report without
          considering the quantity of colour coated sheets in the assessment.


 1.7      Details of the survey:


            a)     Observations made by us during our inspection;
            b)     Documents submitted by the insured during our survey
            c)     Discussions held with and explanations offered by the insured


 1.8      Based on the above we submit our findings, recommendations as
          under for the consideration of the insurers...

 4.0      DESCRIPTION OF THE RISK


 4.1      The risk is situated at Bldg. A, Gat no: 314, 316-234, Village Yelawadi,
          Taluka Khed, Dist. Pune, Maharashtra. Inside the compound there are
          total two warehouses (A & B) of identical type of construction but the
          sizes are different. The total area as per site layout plan is around
          1,68,750 sq. feet. The warehouse has a considerable plinth height. The
          side walls are made up of burnt bricks. Upon which two layers of glass
          panels are fixed using aluminum frames on the two sides (front facing
          sides) & then coated sheet cladding is fixed above it. On other two
          sides the entire height above the burnt brick walls is covered using
          coated sheet cladding. The roof is made up of coated sheets fixed on
          MS frame work. Multiple docks are provided on the front side in order
          to facilitate loading/ unloading operations. The warehouses were
          leased to Reliance Industries (Jio) who store the goods related to
          transmission & mobile networking at the warehouse.


 5.0      INCIDENT


 5.1      As mentioned earlier, there were two separate incidents which

R ud rap rat ap I n di an L ogi st i cs - 1 53 92 /I C I CI /2 0 - 2 1   K am al Bi yan i As s oci at es   5
          caused damages to the insured’s property. The first incident took
          place on 14th May 2020, during which the Chakan region witnessed
          heavy rain fall coupled with stormy winds. Various claims were
          reported from the region due to the said incident. The insured’s
          premises as well as the surrounding area were also affected. Some of
          the glass panels were found cracked & broken. Subsequently some of
          the panels collapsed along with aluminum frame. Roofing sheet at
          one place were seen uprooted from the fixing screw. The damages
          were jointly inspected along with the officials of lessee (i.e. Reliance
          Jio).


 5.2      The second incident took place on 3rd June 2020. The cyclone Nisarga
          had made landfall on 3rd June 2020 & various parts of western
          Maharashtra such as Alibaug, Raigarh, Pune, Navi Mumbai etc. had
          witnessed heavy rainfall & stormy winds. The incident was reported in
          various newspapers all across the country & also covered by Indian
          Metrological Department (the detail report/ analysis is available on
          their official website). Various claims were reported in Pune district
          due to the cyclone. The insured’s premises which was already
          affected in the first incident suffered additional damages to the glass
          panels.


 6.0      OUR INSPECTION & EXTENT OF DAMAGE


 6.1      On receipt of the intimation, we had contacted the official
          concerned (of Reliance Jio) who was working at the site. We
          arranged the visit on 17th May 2020, during which the entire premises
          was thoroughly inspected & photographed. The site official had
          already prepared a list of damages. Still, we again inspected all the
          damages of both the warehouses & jointly recorded the damages.
          The side glass panels were found cracked & broken. At one place the
          roofing sheet were slightly uprooted from the fixing screw. The insured
          was advised to provide repair quotations. However, despite various

R ud rap rat ap I n di an L ogi st i cs - 1 53 92 /I C I CI /2 0 - 2 1   K am al Bi yan i As s oci at es   6
          reminders, the insured did not provide any revert.


 6.2      Thereafter, on 3rd June 2020, due to cyclone there were few more
          damages to the warehouses. Insured was advised to provide
          quotation for the damages. Insured vide mail dated 20 th June 2020
          provided us the quotations. The total amount was as under…
                  Quotation no-FRS6710: Rs. 35,79,412.00
                  Quotation no-FRS6711: Rs. 25,14,875.00
                  Total of above: Rs. 60,94,287.00
          We advised the insured to arrange a joint site visit along with the
          repairer/ contractor so that the damages can be confirmed vis-à-vis
          the quotation.


 6.3      On 1st July 2020, we arranged a joint visit along with the repairer Mr.
          Salim Rehmani of Faisal Roofing Solution Pvt. Ltd. As informed by the
          contractor, the two quotations which were given were having items
          of both the warehouse (A & B) and as per their inspection, they had
          suggested few additional items (which were not present in original
          construction) in order to prevent such losses in the future. The items for
          additional support as per the quotation are as follows:
               1. U Cap (Quotation no: FRS6710)
               2. Butyl tape (Quotation no: FRS6710)
               3. Purlin 2 mm thickness (Quotation no: FRS6711) - for glass frame
          The total amount of the above three additional items was Rs.
          7,77,915.00 from the total quotation value of Rs. 60,94,287.00. Apart
          from the above, the coated sheets and polycarbonate sheets were
          recommended for replacement. However, no such damages were
          observed to the coated sheets and polycarbonate sheets. This was
          highlighted to the contractor as well. Upon which the contractor
          informed us that the quantity was taken on a lum sum basis based on
          their inspection & it was recommended as a safety measure. Glass
          and its frame which was damaged was also part of the quotation.
          Hence, we had suggested to jointly carry out the inspection and

R ud rap rat ap I n di an L ogi st i cs - 1 53 92 /I C I CI /2 0 - 2 1   K am al Bi yan i As s oci at es   7
          quantification of actual damages due to the incident. However, the
          contractor declined to do so and left the premises. They suggested us
          to inspect and quantify the damages independently.


 6.4      Accordingly, we carried out a detailed inspection of both the
          warehouses and the damaged quantity was measured and noted
          down. The glass and its frame were majorly affected in both the
          incidents. The quantity was measured and recorded for both the
          warehouse. The entire roof shed was inspected and photographed.
          No damages were observed to the coated sheets. It was informed
          that the coated sheets at few places were slightly loose and these
          were refitted. It was also informed that 4 polycarbonate sheets (2 in
          each warehouse) were damaged and were replaced in order to
          prevent rainwater ingression inside the warehouse. Rest sheets were
          found unaffected. Our above observations were conveyed to the
          insured on mail on the same day and the quantity working was also
          shared. However, insured did not provide any revert on the same.
          Thereafter, we had shared the assessment based on our above
          observations to the insured on 14th July 2020.


 6.5      The insured was not in agreement with the shared assessment,
          however did not provide revert on the mail. During such discussions,
          the insured had informed that some of the roofing sheets were
          replaced prior to our visit. We had advised the insured to provide
          details of the same with supporting documents. After various
          reminders (telephonic as well as on mail) the insured provided us
          revised quotations on 12th August 2020 as under…
                  Quotation no-FRS6710: Rs. 27,28,750.00 (warehouse B)
                  Quotation no-FRS6711: Rs. 35,40,118.00 (warehouse A)
                  Total of above: Rs. 62,68,868.00
          The above quotations were different from the earlier ones & the
          additional items which were present in the earlier quotations were
          removed from this quotations. Instead the quantity of sheets was

R ud rap rat ap I n di an L ogi st i cs - 1 53 92 /I C I CI /2 0 - 2 1   K am al Bi yan i As s oci at es   8
          increased. No supporting documents/ justifications were provided by
          the insured for such incomprehensible/ unreasonable revisions in the
          new quotations. Nevertheless, being a claim arising out of natural
          cause, in consultation with the insurers, a more liberal assessment was
          shared       with      the     insured      on     19th        August    2020,    ignoring         the
          incomprehensible/ unacceptable revisions in the new quotation.


 6.6      The insured was not in agreement with the revised assessment as well.
          However, they did not provide revert on record/ mail. Even after
          various discussions with the insured & their agents, the matter could
          not be concluded. The major difference was in the quantity of
          coated sheets. As the claim was open for long time, the insurers
          advised us to release the report without considering the quantity of
          coated sheets in the assessment. The assessment for the coated
          sheets will only be done after the insured reinstates the damages &
          also establishes the damages to the roof. This was conveyed to the
          insured in detail on mail dated 12th September 2020.


 7.0      CAUSE OF DAMAGE


 7.1      As mentioned in the section 5.0 of this report, there were two separate
          incidents in which the insured’s property got damaged. In the first
          incident of 14th May 2020, the Chakan region witnessed heavy rainfall
          along with stormy winds which caused damages to various
          properties/ flex boards etc. Various claims were reported in the area
          during the same period. On 3rd June 2020, cyclone Nisarga had
          caused havoc in the Pune & Raigarh district due to relentless rains
          with stormy winds. Many properties suffered severe damages. The
          electricity supply was disrupted as the electricity poles were also
          collapsed. The insured’s property was also affected in the incident.


 7.2      Thus, based on our inspection & information gathered the cause of
          damage is attributed to storm.

             I     The insured has provided only the quotation in support of the
                   claim. The loss is assessed based on the quotation & our
                   observations. As mentioned earlier, the coated sheets are not
                   considered          as     of    now.       Remaining        items     (ventilator      &
                   polycarbonate sheets) are considered as per the quotations.
                   The glass panels are considered as per actual measured area.
                   Proportionate GST amount is also considered as the insured
                   cannot avail set off on the same.


           (-)     Depreciation

                   not     carried        out      reinstatement.         Hence,      depreciation         is
                   applicable. The exact age of the warehouse is not known
                   hence lumsum deduction of 6% is made.


           (-)     Salvage
            III    Insured has not provided any salvage value. We have
                   deducted likely realizable value of Rs. 5000.00 towards salvage.

            IV     The insured has not shared capitalization details or approved
                   layout plan. We have taken the area from the site layout plan
                   and worked out the reinstatement value which was further
                   depreciated to arrive at the market value. The property was
                   found to be adequately covered. Please refer assessment

                   subject to a minimum of Rs. 25,000/-. The same is applied twice
                   (for two incidents) and accordingly, the amount of Rs. 77,033.08
