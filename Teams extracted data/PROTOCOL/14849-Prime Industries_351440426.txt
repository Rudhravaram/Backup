      premises and the surrounding.      The Maharashtra flood incident was
      covered by media channels all over and printed in local as well as
      national newspapers. The entire mill (storage, manufacturing, office
      section) was flooded completely. The stacks were found collapsed and
      in wet condition. These bags were in puffed condition due to prolonged
      contact with water. The whole site was filled with the typical odor

             prolonged contact with water. The stock of rice and paddy was
             damaged due to flood water. Verbal enquiries were made with
             the insured regarding any other storage location (other than the
             subject risk) and whether they stored any third party stock. Insured
             confirmed that they did not have any other storage godown and
             no stock of third party was stored in the insured premises. It was also
             confirmed by the insured prior to loss some of the finished and raw
             material stocks was shifted to friends godown approximately
             costing 70 laks. This lead to loss minimization measure initiated by
             insured.


5.4   Later on the insured provided us a tentative quantum of bags stored in
      the premises and a rough layout drawing of the premises. As per the list

      41 Bags (2050 kg.) and paddy of around 144375 Kgs stored & affected by
