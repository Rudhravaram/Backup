 4.0   CAUSE OF DAMAGE


 4.1   During our inspection the inundation level was clearly visible inside the
       insured’s premises. It was measured at various places. The water level
       inside the premises was around 5 ft.


 4.1   Based on our observations, information provided to us, the cause of loss
       could reasonably have attributed to flood/ inundation.


 5.0   OUR OBSERVATIONS & EXTENT OF DAMAGES


 ►     About The Insured


 5.1   Spark Engineering, established in the year 2018 - is a basically Engineering
       workshop for structural steel and Sheet metal fabrication, CNC sheet
       cutting & bending etc.


 ►     Description of The Risk


 5.2   The risk is situated at Sr.no: 44/9, Narhe Industrial estate, shop no6, near
       Pari company, Pune, maharashtra-411041. The building was having two
       levels (Ground floor + first floor). Insured’s shop is located in ground floor.
       The area was around 500 sq. ft.


 ►     Extent of damages


 5.3   We carried out the survey at the affected location on 27th September
       2019 and subsequently thereafter. At the time of our survey, the water
       had already receded from the premises. The premises were thoroughly
       inspected and photographed. The inundation level was clearly visible
       inside the insured’s premises. The entire contents inside the shop such as


                                                                Page 4|9

       metal sheets, machineries were submerged in the flood water. Broadly
       following two machines were found affected as these were submerged
       in the flood water.
           1) Hydraulic Press Break machine
                     Model: WC67E-100T3200
                     MFG No: 1024016
                     MFG year: 08/2018
           2) Hydraulic Shearing Machine.
                     Model: QC12Y-4 *3200
                     MFG No: 1024017
                     MFG year: 08/2018
       Insured was advised to clean the premises and get both the machines
       inspected by the respective agencies & provide their reports.


 5.4   We once again visited the premises on 9th December 2019 after cleaning
       activity. Both the machines were found affected. As the machines were
       submerged in the water internal important parts such as controller,
       processor, control panel, relay, wiring, servo motor etc. got damaged
       completely. Due to this entire controlling mechanism failed. It was
       informed that the machines are basically imported and hence, the
       damaged parts are not available. Hence, the only alternative was to
       change the entire controlling system with the local one. However, such
       controlling system would not be readily available and has to be tailor
       made. Accordingly, the insured had procured a quotation for such
       complete replacement of controlling mechanism. Mainly repair consist
       of replacement of damaged parts and installing PLC.


 5.5   Insured had provided us quote of Rs. 2141200.00 for NC Hydraulic Press
       Break machine and quote of Rs. 1432043.00 Hydraulic Shearing Machine
       obtained from B. N. Enterprises. We once again visited the premises along
       with an automation expert engaged by us, to cross verify the given


                                                            Page 5|9
15009/ICICI/1920-Spark Engineering
       quotations. The expert also seconded the opinion and quote provided
       by the insured.


 5.6   Thus, liability if any, is limited to mentioned two NC machines only.
       Detailed extent of damage is elaborated in assessment part of report.
