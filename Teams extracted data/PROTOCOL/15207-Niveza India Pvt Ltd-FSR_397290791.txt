         “Aushutosh of VDA InfoTech solution have got call from security
         guard regarding smell of burning on 15th December 2019 at 10.30
         pm. Ashutosh called Sayali and have informed that Smell of burning
         was coming from Niveza and Canwill office. Sayali then called me
         and we reached at office in 10-15 mins. When reached at office, I
         saw that fire brigade and other Teerth techno space supervisors
         were already present there. Water was coming from the office.
         When we opened the office, lot of smoke was observed. Fire person
         stopped us from entering the office and allowed smoke to release.
         Then fire person have entered in the office and have inspected the
         offices. Fire was already put out by sprinklers in the office. Further,
         fire brigade person had closed the sprinkler water supply. After that
         we entered in the office and have seen that office was filled with
         the water. Some of Systems and desks were affected by fire. Being
         Sunday, office was closed & no person was present at the time
         when this event has occurred. We suspect probable cause is short
         circuit near the machines affected.”
