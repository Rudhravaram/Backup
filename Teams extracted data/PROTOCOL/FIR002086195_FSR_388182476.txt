 3.0    INCIDENT


 3.1    It is a matter of common knowledge that Kokan, Kolhapur, Sangli, Satara
        and adjoining cities in Western Maharashtra were flooded due to
        incessant torrential monsoon rains from 26th July onwards. The new was
        covered by various news channels and print media across the nation.
        Insured’s premises were also flooded. Incident narration provided by
        Insured is as follows:


        Quote
        This to inform you that on 04.08.2019 at around 08.00 hrs, rear side of
        boundary wall between ETP gate to New E – Bike plant was collapsed
        due heavy rain and water pressure. The collapsed boundary wall is
        approximate 70 metres and around 10 metre of boundary walls on both
        the sides are also damage & tilted due to bottom soil erode. Considering
        collapsed damage wall total affected wall is around 90 metres long with
        10 feet height approximately.
        Apart from the boundary wall the newly erected Electrical Power Fence
        is also severely damaged due to boundary wall collapse & tilted.
        Since last two days entire Raigad district is seriously affected due to
        heavy to heaviest rain especially in Taloja area and because of that the


                                                                    Page 3|9

        canal flowing between M/s. FG Glass and M/s. Exide Industries was over
        flowing and water entered inside the boundary wall, Consequently the
        base of boundary wall got washed away and hence the entire portion
        of boundary wall collapsed.
        It has been observed that because of heaviest rain falls about 310 mm,
        the entire Taloja MIDC Panvel area was under flood.
        Unquote:
        The incidence report provided by the Insured has been reproduced
        verbatim without any corrections, if any required to be made, with
        regard to spellings and/or grammar


 4.0    CAUSE OF DAMAGE


 4.1    Heavy rains poured in Maharashtra (Bhiwandi, Kolhapur, Sangli, Karad,
        Ichalkarancji, Pune, Raigad etc) Kerala & other many states from 26th July
        2019 to 12th August 2019. Due to this flood situation occurred at many
        places. The incidence is well reported in TV and print media all over the
        countries.


 4.2    A nallah/canal flows adjoining between the insured’s plot and
        neighboring company, F.G. Glass. Insured had built a compound wall
        abutting the plot and nallah. Due to heavy rains, the nallah got flooded.
        The overflowing water washed out the wall leading to its fall. The pressure
        of accumulated water inside the plot (due to heavy rains) also
        contributed to the fall.


 4.3    Thus, based on our observations and information provided to us, the
        cause of loss could reasonably have attributed to flood.
