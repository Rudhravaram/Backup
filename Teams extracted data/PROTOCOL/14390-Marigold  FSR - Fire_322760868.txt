4.0    INCIDENT


4.1    We visited the Insured premises on 20th February 2019. During our
       survey Mr. Shrenik Bora (9850560072) conducted us & narrated the
       incident. It was informed that on 19th February 2019, there was fire at
       their mall. Police authority, fire brigade team were called for. It was
       gathered that shop # 23, 24 (located on first floor) were given on
       leave & license agreement to M/s. Poonam Enterprises (franchisee of
       Brand Mart) for the period of 1.5.2017 to 5.5.2018. The area was
       around 750 sq ft. The fire reportedly had originated in shop #23 of
       Brandmart. The incident report provided by the Brandmart person is
       reproduced below…


       (Quote)
4.2    I the under signed Sandip Matte owner of Brandmart hereby state
       the incidence of fire breakout at the shop 23 & 24 in Mariplex Mall,
       Kalyani Nagar, Pune 411 014. The store was operational as usual. At
       around 8 p.m. my cashier Mr. Sunil Das smelled a burning smell in the
       back store near the changing room. He entered the back store and
       found that there was fire breakout near the changing room. As soon
       as he saw the fire breakout he tried to extinguish the fire with the fire
       extinguisher and tried to extinguish the fire. However, the shop being
       a cloth retail shop, the fire was spreading very rapidly and leaving
       tremendous smoke. There was no visibility due to the smoke. As a
       safety measures the mall mangers cut off the electricity supply to
       avoid any further short circuits. Everyone was evacuated from the
       mall safely. Meanwhile the fire brigade were also informed about the
       incident. 5 nos of fire brigade vans came to extinguish the fire. The
       fire was controlled and extinguished by the fire fighting team
       efficiently.

4.3    The incidence report provided by the Insured has been reproduced
       verbatim without any corrections, if any required to be made, with
       regard to spellings and/or grammar.


5.0    CAUSE OF FIRE


5.1    The exact cause of fire is not known. It was reported the fire had
       probably occurred due to short circuit. In the newspaper cutting,
       police panchnama & in the insured’s narration the cause was
       mentioned due to electrical short circuit. The premises were
       inspected by us and damages were noted. The entire shop was
       gutted in the fire and the electrical wiring/ fittings were found burnt.


5.2    The supporting documents such as police panchnama, fire brigade
       report, newspaper cuttings were provided to us. Thus, based on the
       information & our inspection the cause of fire could most reasonably
       be attributed to due to electrical short circuit.


6.0    EXTENT OF DAMAGE


6.1    During our survey Mr. Shirinik Bora conducted us & narrated the
       incident. It was informed that there was fire at their premises on 19th
       February 2019.


6.2    The premises were inspected by us. The fire had originated in the
       shop by name – Brandmart located on first floor. The fire spread
       further in the passage. The electrical, ducting, POP etc. got burnt.
       The soot generated got spread all over the mall. Due to closed
       structure (centralized AC), the soot travelled upto top floor. The
       water used in firefighting also added to the damages.

6.3    Thereafter, we again visited at the insured premises for verification of
       the affected material on 21st & 22nd February 2019. Detailed listing of
       the affected items was made along with the insured. The details are
       as under…


6.4         The POP of the shop and the first floor was burnt. Moreover, the
             water used in extinguishment had added to the damages. The
             water percolated to the ground floor and the ground floor POP
             ceiling was also affected.
            The electrical wiring of the first floor was badly damaged.

7.0    INSUREDS’ CLAIM VIS-A-VIS ADIMISSIBILITY


7.1    The insured had lodged their claim for Rs 82,99,170.00. The detailed
       claim statement is attached as Annexure to the report.


  ►    Cause                      Fire
  ►    Date of loss               19th February 2019
  ►    Policy Period              22.11.2018 to 21.11.2019
  ►    Risk location              Marigold Complex,
                                  Kalyani Nagar,
                                  Pune, Maharashtra


7.2    The date of loss, the cause of loss, location of risk falls within the
       purview of the policy and the claim lodged by the Insured is tenable.


8.0    ASSESSMENT OF LOSS


8.1    Our Assessment of loss is based on our inspection & documents
       submitted by the Insured. The supporting documents are attached to
       the report.


8.2    Following points are crucial from the assessment of loss point of view:


         I   During the survey, the insured had provided us the list of the
             affected items. A tentative claimed amount was also provided.
             Being a mall, footfall of customers was continuous, as other
             establishments were working. The insured was very worried of
             business interruption due to repair work. Hence, it was decided
             that the repairs would be carried out in two stages – Urgent,
             Important but not urgent.
             For example, POP ceiling of first floor was burnt out and ground



Marigold 14390/ICICI/18-19                              Kamal Biyani Associates   7
              floor   was    swollen     due    to    water    ingression.     The
              repair/replacement of first floor was very urgent. Though, the
              POP of ground floor was damaged; to carry out the
              replacement of ground floor, the normal operations of the
              restaurant would be disrupted. Hence, insured was not in
              position to execute it immediately. Similarly, the painting of front
              areas was started immediately. However, painting of utilities,
              trusses, though required, was to be carried out post completion
              of urgent repairs/replacement/painting. This obviously was time
              consuming. Hence, purchase orders of all the works could not
              be issued.


         II   In support of the claim the insured had submitted quotations,
              purchase/work orders. As the complete reinstatement was not
              done (due to reasons mentioned above), the final invoices
              were not available. We have assessed the loss on the basis of
              work orders (if the work order is final) &/or quotation (wherein
              the final work order is not issued due to proposed completion of
              work in stages). The insured claim statement is thoroughly
              examined/studied. Necessary adjustment were made & finally
              assessed the loss. The insured is in the business of leasing out the
              premises. Hence, the assessment is carried out without GST.


        III   The property belonging to mall is only considered under the
              claim. Thus, furniture, fixtures of the Brand Mart are not claimed
              and considered in the assessment. As elaborated earlier,
              though, separate sum insured is taken for the different items,
              the books were not having similar bifurcation. Hence, we have
              not bifurcated the assessment into various headings of the
              policy. However, we confirm that we have only considered the
              items covered under the policy headings.

        (-)   Depreciation


        IV    The policy is with RIV clause. However, the insured had not
              completed the reinstatement and hence depreciation is
              applicable. The mall was in operation since last 10 years.
              Moreover, due to similar fire incident, major renovation was
              carried out around 1.5 years back. The entire painting was
              redone at that time. Considering this aspect, a lumsum
              deduction of 25% was done on the gross assessed loss in lieu of
              depreciation.


        (-)   Salvage


         V    Most of the material was damaged in the fire. The affected
              material is not fit for its intended use and would only realize
              terminal scrap value. The quotation of Rs. 20,000.00 was
              received from a scrap buyer. During further discussion the
              insured was advised to dispose off the scrap for the value of
              26,000/-. Thus, Rs. 26000/- is deducted.


        (-)   Underinsurance:


        VI    The mall was constructed by a builder and handed over to the
              present owner. Hence, most of the capitalization was done
              under the heading of building, as item level breakup was not
              provided by the builder. Though, for availing coverage, the
              insured had provided separate sum insured of various headings
              such as building, plant and machinery, air conditioning,
              escalators; the books were not having the same breakup. As
              elaborated earlier, the insured had suffered a major loss in 2016.
              The total sum insured during that period was Rs. 20.00 Crores.



Marigold 14390/ICICI/18-19                               Kamal Biyani Associates   9
              The, then surveyor, had found underinsurance for some items
              (on RIV basis). Hence, the insured had increased the sum
              insured considerably during subsequent renewal. The total sum
              insured was increased to Rs. 35.00 Crores from Rs. 20.00 Crores.
              Presently, the assessment is done on market value basis, thus,
              the items are adequately covered. Still, a comparative table is
              as under…

        (-)   Recovery


        VII   The fire had taken place in the shop of Brandmart accidentally.
              The source of short circuit was not clear. In the shop the
              electrical wiring is provided by the mall (insured). Thus, in our
              opinion, the recovery is not possible.


        (-)   Exclusion


        VIII The exact origin of the fire could not be identified. Moreover,
