 7.0   ASSESSMENT OF LOSS


 7.1   Our assessment of loss is based on our inspection & documents submitted
       by the Insured. The supporting documents are enclosed with the report.


 7.2   Following points are crucial from the assessment of loss point of view:


 (-)   DEPRECIATION:
 7.3   Plant and machinery: The exact age details for damaged Dg set were
       not available and hence the depreciation of 25% is applied and
       accordingly deduction were made.
       FFF: The exact age details were not available and hence the
       depreciation of 50% is applied and accordingly deduction were made.


 (-)   SALVAGE
 7.4   The damaged items (machinery and FFF) were not fit for the intended
       use. We have deducted 5% each as notional scrap value towards
       salvage for ‘Plant and machinery’ and ‘FFF’. Accordingly, deduction
       were made in the assessment.


 (-)   UNDERINSURANCE:
 7.5   P&M: The exact value for total plant and machinery as on date of loss
       was not provided to us. Based on our inspection 25% underinsurance is
       applied for plant of machinery. Hence amount of Rs.128077.04 is
       deducted on account of underinsurance for P & M.
       FFF: As per our observation FFF was found adequately covered. Hence
       no underinsurance is applied for FFF.


 (-)   EXCESS:
 7.6   As per policy 5% of claim amount sub to min of Rs. 25,000.00/- is
       deducted.
