          Peril operated                   Covered.


5.0   TENTATIVE ASSESSMENT OF LOSS:


      Insured have provided us quotation acquired from Mayur consultants
      towards repair (painting) to the building. Insured have not provided us
      final bills. Based on quotation received, we have tentatively assessed
      the loss.
      The tentative assessment works out Rs. 115210.43. Detailed working is
      attached as Annexure to the report.


6.0   Reason for closer:


6.1   Our observation during inspection are as under:
            As informed by Insured, flat number of visited premises where loss
             had occurred – 107



                                                            Page 3|5
            Flat number physically painted on wall of Insured’s house-
             105/106
            On common board of society following names were appearing
             against the respective flat number are as follows:

               Flat No.          Name on society board
               104         Mrs. Shraddha Shivraj Shinde
               105         Mr. Mangilal Chhaganlal chhaged
               106         Mrs. Pramila Chhaganlal Chhaged.
               107         Mr. Rishbhlal c. Chhajed


      Loss location is “Flat no 107”, whereas location covered under the Policy
      held by Insured is “Flat no 104, A to D, Vrindavan apartment”- which is
      altogether different. Thus there is discrepancy in addresses.
      We have conveyed our observation to Insured and have asked him to
      provide clarification for the discrepancy in address with supporting
      documents. Despite our several reminders, Insured have not provided
      any documents establishing coverage of risk location.


6.2   In view of above, it is clear that location of loss is not covered under the
      subject SFSP policy held by Insured. The claim lodged by Insured is not
      payable and hence we are closing our file as “No claim”. We have
      conveyed the same to insured vide our mail dated 5th November 2019.


7.0   This report is issued without prejudice & subject to the terms, conditions
      and warranties to the policy issued to & held by the insured.
