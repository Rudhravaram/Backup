5.0   ASSESSMENT OF LOSS


5.1   The insured has lodged a claim of Rs. 10,59,941.88 and has provided
      supporting quotations/ estimates. The assessment is carried out based on
      the same. The detail assessment with all the annexures is attached with the
      report. Please find below points with regards to the assessment.


5.2   The amount claimed by the insured towards building was found on higher
      side. We have reasonably deducted 10% towards variation in the
      damaged quantity as claimed by the insured.
            Depreciation: The polyhouse structure was 5 years old and hence,
             depreciation of 50% (10% per year) was applied.
            Salvage: No salvage value would be realizable. Hence, no
             deduction is made towards the salvage.
            Underinsurance: The total area of the polyhouse was around 4000
             sq. meter. The current market rate for Polyhouse structure were
             considered in 8217 sq. m. Accordingly, the reinstatement value was
             calculated and after applying the depreciation the present market
             value was ascertained which was Rs. 5677687.2 while the sum
             insured is Rs. 9525000, hence, the polyhouse structure is adequately
             covered. Please refer annexure I of the assessment for detail
             working.
            Excess: The excess as per policy is 5% of claim amount subject to
