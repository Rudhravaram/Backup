3.0    INCIDENT


       It is a matter of common knowledge that Kolhapur, Sangli, Satara and
       adjoining cities in Western Maharashtra were flooded due to incessant
       torrential monsoon rains from 4th August 2019 onwards. The incident was
       covered by various news channels and print media across the nation.
       Insured’s premises was also flooded in the incident. We have gathered
       that the water level reached around 10-11 feet height around the
       insured’s premises due to flooding/inundation. Stocks stored in Insured’s
       shop were submerged into the muddy/contaminated water for 9 days.
       Retaining wall also got damaged due to accumulated flood water.
       Stagnated flood water receded on 13th August 2019.

4.0   CAUSE OF DAMAGE


4.1   Heavy rains poured in Maharashtra (Bhiwandi, Kolhapur, Sangli, Karad,
      Ichalkarancji, Pune etc) Kerala & other many states from 26th July 2019 to
      12th August 2019. Due to this flood situation occurred at many places. The
      incidence is well reported in TV and print media all over the countries.
      Due to this, water logged at insured’s named location.


4.2   Thus, based on our observations and information provided to us, the
      cause of loss could reasonably have attributed to flood.


5.0   OUR OBSERVATIONS & EXTENT OF DAMAGES
►     About Insured.


5.1   The insured is authorized two wheeler dealer of Honda Motorcycle &
      Scooters India Ltd. The showroom is located in a leased premise.


►     Description of The Risk
5.2   The risk is situated at S No 269/1/2/3, Aundh Hijewadi BRTS Road, Sahara
      Chowk, Shedge Wasti, Wakad, Pune – 411057. It is occupied as
      showroom cum service station for Honda two wheelers. The premises
      can be identified into two sections – Front Showroom and Storage yard
      (located on the rear side of the risk).


5.3   The showroom was double storied RCC structure with panel walls of bricks
      and roof of RCC. Considerable elevation difference was observed
      between the front side and rear side of the risk. This had probably taken
      place due to land filling done by the public authorities while constructing
      the public road. Hence, a level difference got generated. The main
      showroom was constructed in two levels to use this level difference. On
      upper level the showroom was located while, the lower level was being


                                                            Page 4|8
      occupied for servicing set up. The open yard was at the level of servicing
      workshop and was being mainly used for the storage of new two
      wheelers. The service vehicles were also stored in the yard.


►     Observations and Extent of damages


5.4   We carried out the survey on 7th August 2019. The insured has dealership
      of Honda two wheelers wherein sales and service is provided. The building
      was having two levels (Lower floor + Ground floor). The entire lower floor
      was submerged to the level of 5 to 8 feet. The stocks of two wheelers was
      kept under shed as well as in open yard. The premises was very near to
      the river and hence the level of inundation was very high. Water marks
      and mud traces were seen inside the lower floor. Damages can be briefly
      elaborated as under:
          Stock, FFF- The stocks of new two wheelers, workshop equipment,
            FFF got damaged to flood water.
          Building: Rain water was accumulated for 3-4 days around
            retaining wall on the back side of open yard. Accumulated flood
            water had exerted pressure/load on the wall leading to formation
            of cracks to the retaining wall. Painting on wall was also got
            affected at some places.


5.5   Insured have taken another policy for the stock coverage. Only building
      is covered under this STFI Policy. Thus, the liability, if any, is limited to the
      damages to the building only.
