          documents, as provided by Insured, we are issuing our report.


 6.0      CAUSE OF FIRE AND ITS TRAVEL PATTERN


 6.1      The cause of damage is fire. The exact cause of fire is not known.
          Insured had verbally informed that the reported fire had taken place
          On 14th September 2018 @ 8.30 a.m. burning smell in PGR 4 of Lab 2

                  MSEB Report - Enclosure           The fire was not due to short
                                                     circuit
                  Investigator report - Enclosure   Electrical short circuit


 6.3      The insurers have engaged an expert “ICS Assure Services Pvt. Ltd.,
          Mumbai“ to ascertain the exact source and origin of fire. As per their
          report the cause is concluded as under. …….
          (Quote)
          “Based on the fire origin and fire pattern analysis and other
          observations we are of the
          opinion that:
          a. As per fire pattern analysis , fire damage interpretation and level
          of hot spots at areas of lab-2 we are at opinion that fire would have
          initiated inside lab-2
          (under-ceiling structure) near PIR-1/PGR-8 located at RHS of lab -2.
          b. Based on the above analysis in our opinion, there is no probability
          of fire through externally introduced ignition source or due to
          spontaneous combustion. Fire would have been caused due to
          electrical short circuit in between the false ceiling and the main roof
          of the RHS of Lab - 2. (Just above PGR - 8 and PIR - 1)
          (UnQuote)


 6.4      Thus, based on our inspection & other documents, the cause of
          damage is an accidental fire.

 8.0      METHODOLOGY OF ASSESSMENT OF LOSS


 8.1      The assessment of loss is based on our inspection & documents
          submitted by the Insured. Insured have opted to go ahead with the
          market value basis and hence, the loss assessment is based on the
          quotations. It may be noted that during the process of the survey
          each and every item was inspected by us. Various filters/adjustments
          such as usable/unusable, repairable/irreparable were applied to the
          initial list generated by the insured. The final assessment is based on
          such      final    list   generated    after   due    vetting/verifications.        The
          supporting documents are enclosed with the report. Following points

          are crucial from assessment point of view.


  ►       Building
          The insured have lodged claim of Rs. 4,11,05,894/-, The insured has
          submitted quotations of various items of the building. During survey,
          the detailed examination of the items were carried out to ascertain
          the exact extent of damages. The insurers have appointed an
          expert, M/s Aaryan Structcon Pvt. Ltd for evaluation of the damages.
          The expert had submitted the detailed estimate of repairs. The claim
          value of the insured was generally found in sync with the estimate
          provided by the expert. The assessment is carried out on the basis of
          such estimate. However, the expert had not evaluated few items
          under the building heading. These items were assessed on the basis
          of the quotations provided by the insured, which were suitably
          adjusted. In case of PIR panels, the insured had submitted a
          quotation of different specification. Reasonable value of the original
          specification was considered.


          The insured have lodged claim of Rs. 13,78,500/-, towards dismantling
          charges, as per policy we have considered 1% of the claim amount
          towards debris removal as per assessment attached. The detailed
          assessment sheet is attached as Annexure I to the report.


  ►       Machinery
          Insured       has     lodged           the        claim    of   Rs.12,17,11,527/-        towards
          repair/replacement              cost         of    Plant    &    Machineries.          Following
          methodology is adopted…


          1.       A detailed – item level – claim bill giving unit rate and quantity
          affected was presented by the insured.
          2.       The quantity claim is adjusted as per the quantity verified
          during the survey. This considered quantity was further cross checked


Ris e N Shi ne – 1 4 0 9 6 /I CIC I / 1 8- 1 9                            Ka ma l Bi ya ni As s o ci at es   12
          with FAR. The minimum of two (claimed or as per FAR) is considered.
          The items which are claimed and found damaged during the survey,
          but not found in FAR are not considered. Certain items such as
          bottles, trays, pp caps were completely burnt and no sort of physical
          quantification was possible. The insured had claimed the quantity as
          per the reported capacity of the damaged lab-2. We have
          extracted the capitalization details of such items. It was observed
          that the capitalized quantity of these items was lower. Hence, the
          capitalized quantity was only considered in the assessment.
          3.       The items which were repairable were assessed for repairs. In
          case of complete replacement of the items, the supporting
          quotations of the damaged items were provided by the insured. It
          was observed that the insured was erecting a new laboratory in the
          same premises. Similar items were also being procured for the new
          lab. Hence, we have collected the purchase orders of these items.
          During the assessment, we have considered the lower of Quotation
          Value or PO Value. This has helped us in removing any exaggeration/
          negotiation component from the quotation value. In few items, PO
          was not available. In such cases, we have deducted 10% as likely
          component of negotiation. The specifications of the damaged items
          vis-à-vis new items were also studied. In case of difference, suitable
          deductions were also made. The claimed amount was also
          compared with the amount of capitalization shown in the books. In
          the assessment annexure, detailed remarks are given against each
          item.


          The detailed assessment sheet is attached as Annexure II to the
          report.

          2.       The original procurement invoices were submitted by the
          insured.
          3.       Replacement value is considered as per above Invoices, as no
          quote submitted by Insured.
          4.       Depreciation is applied as per age of the affected lab.
          5.       As items were completely damaged – No salvage was
          realizable, hence no deduction made.
          6.       In view of small loss & market value settlement, Sum-Insured is
          considered to be adequate, hence detailed under Insurance
          working not done.

  ►       Building, Plant & Machinery, Computer, FFF
          Insured have forwarded the year wise capitalization value since
          inception of the plant (2004-2005 to 2017-2018). The building was
          evaluated with CPWD index. For machinery, based on the actual RIV
          and the original capitalization value, multiplication factor was
          devised. This multiplication factor was increased/decreased for 5%
          per year, Based on Available data, the adequacy is worked out. The
          detailed working is attached as Annexures to the assessment sheet.
