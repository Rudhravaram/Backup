3.0    INCIDENT


3.1    We visited the premises on 1st November 2019. During our visit Mr.
       Nikhil Chhajed - Proprietor of the firm ‘Navakar Enterprises’ and
       his father Mr. Dipak Chhajed have conducted us around and
       narrated the incident.


3.2    The fire incident have reportedly occurred at night at insured’s
       premises on 30th October, 2019 and it was first witnessed by the
       person staying in the nearby building at 7:30 a.m. Further he had
       informed Mr. Dipak Chhajed and Savita Chhajed (Parents of
       proprietor of Navkar enterprise) about fire. They were at the
       residence situated on 1st floor of the bulding. The power of the
       building reportedly went off due to the fire, but they did not
       come to know about it. They came to know when people from




15118/ICICI/1920-Navkar Enterprizes
       outside had informed them at 7:30 a.m. Mr. Nikhil Chhajed was
       not present at the place on the day.


3.3    We have reproduced the gist of the narration given by the
       insured. The original narration (in vernacular) given by the insured
       is enclosed with the report.


4.0    ABOUT THE INSURED


4.1    The insured- ‘M/s. Navkar Enterprises’ is a proprietorship firm
       which is in the trading of computer hardware, peripherals,
       accessories and other electronics goods, CCTV installation etc.
       Mr. Nikhil Dipak Chhajed is the proprietor of the fIrm. As informed
       verbally, the firm became operational in 2013. Between 2013 to
       2016, it had only one business establishement at Junnary. In 2016,
       it started operations at Pune also. The Pune operations were
       closed in June 2019 and the stocks were shifted to Junnar. Stock
       was stored in the small tin shed (which was erected in May 2019)
       built behind the main shop at Ravivar Peth, Junnar. The subject
       building is owned by Mrs. Savita Dipak Chhejed. It was also
       informed that between 2016 to 2019, the Pune premises was
       shifted thrice.


5.0    CAUSE OF DAMAGE VIS-À-VIS ADMISSIBILITY



5.1    At the time of our inspection, Insured’s premises was thoroughly
       inspected by us. Exact cause of fire could not be astertained at
       the time of inspection. Fire brigade from muncipalty was
       reportedly called to put off the fire. Police complaint was also
       reportedly lodged. The copy of police panchnama and Talathi



15118/ICICI/1920-Navkar Enterprizes
       Panchnama were provided to us. However, Fire brigade report
       was not provided to us.


5.2    During survey, insured had narrated the incidence. The narration
       was not commensurate with the physical conditions observed
       during the survey.


5.3    The shed was having two rolling shutters. Every rolling shutter
       have two locking arrangement (having one fixed latch and
       other movable). The movable latch and fixed latch are always
       locked together. At the time of our survey, a lock was found in
       only one latch (in both the shutters). This is very strange. The
       insured came to know about the fire, after three hours. As per
       narration given by the insured, by the time the insured came to
       know about the fire, the walls, staircase of adjoining RCC
       building became very hot! The shutters could not be opened fire
       fighting. In such scenario, how the shutter locks were only in one
       latch i.e. the shutters were not in locked condition.


5.4    Similarly, the kind of stocks, the estimate being indicated by the
       insured did not seem convincing. The cause of fire was not clear.
       Hence, we advised insurers to engange the services of a
       professional   investigator.   Accordingly,    Bombay     Forensic,
       Mumbai was appointed by the insurers. The investigator carried
       out detailed investigation and found lot of discrepancies. It
       concluded as under…


       (Quote)
       Based on the Fire Forensic and Analysis of the fire affected site of
       incident followed by search, identification, collection, testing
       and analysis of physical evidence, scrutiny of documentary

15118/ICICI/1920-Navkar Enterprizes
          evidence, it is concluded that the incident of fire reported to
          have occurred at tin shed constructed behind Navkar Enterprises
          situated at Raviwar Peth, Varali Ali, Junnar, Maharashtra 410502
          on 30/10/2019 Wednesday, at around 02:30 am was…
                  a) not due to electrical short circuit,
                  b) not due to any natural causes, but
                  c) due external source of origin of fire.
          Motive:
            i.       The Insured’s business was almost closed since last 6-7
                     months.
            ii.      Only old type, unused items burnt in the fire which were
                     maximum belonging to the insured’s father’s business.
           iii.      There were no latest goods/materials belonging to Navkar
                     Enterprises.
           iv.       The Insured is mis-representing the facts about the volume
                     of goods/material belonging to Navkar Enterprises.
           v.        Insured is non-cooperative to provide the CCTV of full day,
                     the purchase record bills and financial year 18-19

          attached with report for the ready reference.


6.0       OUR OBSERVATIONS AND EXTENT OF DAMAGE


      ➢   Description of the risk


6.1       Risk      covered     under    the   Policy   is   a   shop   located   at
          Ravivar peth, Junnar, Dist Pune 410412. It is multistoried RCC
          building, accupied as shop and and residence. The building is


15118/ICICI/1920-Navkar Enterprizes
       owned by Mrs. Savita Dipak Chhejed. The shop is on the ground
       floor whereas the upper floors are occupied as residence of Mr.
       Chhajed. The area of the shop is approximately 600 sq ft with a
       mezzanine floor of 400 sq ft. The main shop was also bifurcated
       into two section (by wooden racks). This section had separate
       rolling shutter and PVC pipes were stored in this section (at the
       time of surveey). Apart from Navkar Enterprises, two other firms
       named as “M/s. Apna Jwellery & gift house” & “M/s. Apna
       Electrical & Sanitary” also operates out of the shop. The details
       are as under:
          1) Navkar Enterprises– Proprietor Nikhil Chhajed – Deals into
              the electronics, computer peripherals, electrical etc.
             2)Apana Electricals: - Proprietor Dipak Chhajed. Deals into
             sanitary, plumbing material.
             3)Apana Jewelry: - Proprietor Savita Dipak Chhajed. It is
             located on the mezzanine floor of the shop. It deals into
             ladies items such imitation jewllery, gift articles etc.


6.2    A tin shed measuring 15 feet x 18 feet approximately was
       constructed behind the main shop in the month of May 2019. The
       material shifted from Pune (after closure of Pune shop) was
       reportedly stored in this shed. It was extension shed, erected by
       using two external walls of the building. GI sheet/Rollling shutter
       was used to close it from the remaining two sides.


7.0    Extent of Damages


7.1    We carried out the survey on 1st November 2019. The premises
       was thoroughly inspected by us. The fire had taken place in the
       rear side tin shed. It was found damaged/burnt. The GI sheets
       were found uprooted/warped due to heat. The rolling shutters


15118/ICICI/1920-Navkar Enterprizes
       were observed jammed slightly. PVC pipe of the main building
       were found heat affected. The CCTV camera was completely
       burnt in the fire. The main building housing the shop was found
       sound. The shop was also completely safe.


7.2    The stocks in the tin shed was reportedly kept in racks &/or floor.
       The steel racks were taken out from the shed prior to our visit
       found deformed and bent. Inside the shed, burnt remains of
       wooden counter electrical fittings, batteris, fan, electric motor
       covers, steel utensils, SMPS, CPU etc. were observed. Most of
       these items such as tubelight choke, halogen lamps, motor
       starters are not currently salable models. The debris even had
       some    broken     wash    basin/sanitary      items.   One   unusable
       refrigerator was also observed burnt. Such kind of storage of
       assorted   items    (utensils,   electrical,   hardware,   electronics,
       electrical, household goods etc.) very clearly indicated that the
       unusable or discarded items were stored in the tin shed. It is
       noteworthy that the main shop of the insured was a pucca shop
       and was having space to accommodate additional stocks. The
       insured could not given any justifiable answer about reasons for
       storage of costly items (as reported by the insured) in the tin shed
       and low cost bulky items in the main shop.


7.3    As elaborated earlier, the family owns three firms, which
       reportedly operates out of one premises only. Based on the items
       available in the debris, most of the stocks seems to be pertaining
       to the business of the father and mother of the insured (other
       family concerns).


7.4    The insured informed that the stocks worth Rs. 40 lakhs is burnt in
       fire. The available, debris were not at all commensurate with it.


15118/ICICI/1920-Navkar Enterprizes
       However, the physical quantification was not possible. The
       insured had informed that the stocks is maintained in the
       software. When we tried to extract the stocks, statement, certain
       stocks was found in negative. Thereafter, the insured informed
       that some sales and purchases are yet to be entered in the
       system. One of the sales bill (presented for our examination) of
       Navkar Enterprise, was even listing out the electrical, hardware
       item.


7.5    We had inspected the main shop also. The main display board
       was displaying names of two firms – Apana Electricals and
       Navkar Enterprises. In the board itself, the common item list
       (trading items) such as PVC, GI, CI pipes its fittings, electrical,
       plumbing, plywood ited etc. On the board, “Repairing” is also
       mentioned as one of the activity of the insured. The name of the
       other family firm – Apna Jewllery is also observed on seprate
       display board.


7.6    The main shop was having stocks of electrical, hardware,
       plumbing items on the ground floor. The bulky but low cost items
       such as PVC pipe fittings, pipes. The bifurcated portion of the
       main shop was storing the PVC pipes. The mezzanine floor was
       exclusively occupied by Apna Jewellers.


8.0    INSURED’S CLAIM VIS-À-VIS ADMISSIBILITY


8.1    Insured had given us estimate for stocks loss for Rs. 30,63,053/-. In
       addition, the building loss for Rs. 1,50,000.00 is also claimed.


8.2    As elaborated earlier, the investigator had concluded that the
       fire is not accidental.


15118/ICICI/1920-Navkar Enterprizes
8.3    Moreover, we have observed following aspects…
          •   As elaborated in the earlier part of the report, the shutter
              locks indicated that the premises was not locked.
          •   As per the CCTV recording, the fire started at around
              2.41.03 am. The insured came to know about the fire at
              around 7.30 a.m. Considering the compact size of the
              shed, the premises should have been in flames within one
              hour only.
          •   Thus, the narration given by the insured is not factual.
          •   Since few years, the business of Navkar Enterprises, is being
              run from a front shop (multistoried RCC structure). The shed
              wherein the burnt stocks was kept was reportedly
              constructed in May 2019 - after April 2019.
          •   The insurance policy started on 2nd April 2019. Thus, the
              shed was not in existence as on date of inception of the
              policy. Thus, this shed and its contents are not covered
              under the policy issued to and held by the insured –
              1001/168667636/00/000.
          •   In the bank records, the photographs of the front shop are
              only available. Thus, it is very clear that the insurance
              policy only covers, the front pucca shop only.
          •   As per the tax chalan of Junnar Nagarparishad, dated
              31.10.2019, the type of the construction was building of
              stone/brick masonry. Insured have also not submitted any
              approved drawing/document of the shed. Thus, this shed
              of GI sheet was illegal construction. Any illegal item is
              outside the purview of any insurance policy.


8.4    In view of above observations, the claim lodged by insured does
       not fall within the purview of the policy and hence not




15118/ICICI/1920-Navkar Enterprizes
          admissible. We have conveyed our observations to the Insured
          vide our mail dated 18th March 2020.


9.0       ASSESSMET OF LOSS


9.1       The claim lodged by Insured is not admissible. However based on
          documents submitted by the Insured and our inspection, we
          have assessed the loss for academic purpose and without the
          admission of liability.


9.2       The insured had submitted previous years balance sheets. Since
          2016-17, the turnover of the insured was continuously decreasing
          and whereas the closing stocks was continuously increasing. The
          details are as under….


F.Y.              Sales (Rs.)           Closing Remarks
                                    Stocks (Rs.)
2016 - 17       2,612,022.00        1,890,500.00 In first 7 months of 2019-20, the
2017 - 18       1,957,124.00       2,726,700 .00 sales was Rs.219,838.00. If the
2018 - 19       2,022,844.00        3,410,200.00 same rate was continued the
2019 - 20         376,865.00        3,703,402.00 turnover for entire year would
                                                   have     been      Rs.376865.20
                                                   (219838/7x12)


9.3       Similarly, we had done analysis of Sales to Closing stock ratio for
          last year. Phenomenal increase was observed in this ratio. The
          details are as under..


FINANCIAL YEAR (F.Y)                        CLOSING STOCK % WITH SALES
2012-13 (First Year of Operation                            0.00
2013-14                                                    36.95 %
2014-15                                                    34.83 %
2015-16                                                    63.35 %
2016-17                                                    72.38 %

15118/ICICI/1920-Navkar Enterprizes
2017-18                                                       139.32 %
2018-19                                                       168.58 %
Prov. 01.04.19 to 29.10.2019                                  1684.60 %


9.4       Such phenomenal increase from 36.95 % to 1684.60% is
          completely unbelievable. In fact, huge increase is observed from
          2017-18    onwards.       In       other    way,    this   indicates,   heavy
          accumulation of dead/non moving stocks. Hence, while
          assessing the loss for academic purpose, we have deducted 50%
          for dead/non moving stocks.


9.5       The insured had submitted balance sheet as on 29.10.2019. The
          Gross Profit works out to be 126.52%. This is absurd. It means the
          profit earned by the insured (Rs. 278,144.00) is more than the total
          sales (Rs.219,838.00). Evenfor the last year (2018-19), the gross
          profit (41.60%) jumped by more than 250% compared to 2016-17
          and 2017-18 (16%). Thus, the accounts are not at all reliable.


9.6       Nevertheless, for carrying out the assessment for academic
          purpose, we have adopted following methodology….


      ➢   The trading account of 2018-19 is reworked by normalizing GP to
          16%.


O/p 01.04.18                   2,726,700      Sales                         2,022,844

      ➢   With this new closing stocks, the trading account of 2019-20 is
          also reworked out by normalzing GP to 16%.
