1.0      BACKGROUND


1.1      M/s. Jain Agarbatti, has suffered a fire loss at their premises reportedly
         on 23rd March 2017. They have initially lodged claim against HDFC
         Ergo General Insurance Co. Ltd. The HDFC Ergo General Insurance
         Co. Ltd., had appointed a surveyor Sudhir Tondan & Co. who has
         surveyed the loss and issued the survey report. The surveyor had
         assessed the loss for Rs. 9132500.00 and restricted the liability to the
         sum insured Rs. 52,71,000.00. As we understand, after considerable
         period the insured had lodged the claim against their another policy
         with ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co. Ltd.


1.2      On 16th March 2019 ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co. Ltd.,
         Mumbai appointed us for the survey of the same loss.


1.3      As the instructions were received after considerable period, the
         physical inspection was not possible. ICICI Lombard General
         Insurance Co. Ltd., forwarded an unsigned copy of survey report of
         Sudhir Tandon & Co. In continuation, we advised insured to forward
         us the supporting documents, more particularly the tally data. The
         submitted documents were          analyzed in detail       and   various



M/s. Paresh Marketing –12914/ICICI/16-17                Kamal Biyani Associates 2
      discrepancies were observed. These were forwarded to the insured
      vide mail dated 15th April 2019 (Enclosure 1). Insured vide their mail
      dated 11th May 2019 had forwarded their reply (Enclosure 2).
      However, the queries were not answered completely. After some
      efforts by way of telephonic discussion, a meeting was held at
      insurers’ office with the insured and their chartered accountant on
      4th July 2019, wherein all the queries were once again explained.
      The minutes were forwarded to the insured vide mail dated 4th July
      2019, which reads as under….


           1. Goods return amount to INR 675,015.00. We believe that
               these are not good returns but are write offs which should be
               booked in profit and loss account and not in trading
               account. The value of closing stock will reduce by 675,015.00:
               You will be providing the supporting details of the original
               sales, return and reasons for the returns with supporting
               details.
           2. Quantitative details are not maintained. Closing stock value is
               not auto-calculated through system but punched into the
               system : During the meeting you have provided us the signed
               copy of the breakup. However, the basis of such breakup
               could not be provided by you. You have agreed to provide
               the exact methodology (with detailed calculations) of
               ascertaining the quantity damaged and rates claimed.
               Similar breakup for the opening stocks also need to be
               provided. We would be requiring the statement to be
               certified by your CA.
           3. Increase in GP: You have explained that this is in lieu of the
               increase in the sales value. You have agreed to provide the
               comparative details to establish such increase in sales value.
               This analysis should be mainly done for other than Paresh


M/s. Paresh Marketing –12914/ICICI/16-17           Kamal Biyani Associates 3
               Marketing. If it is pertaining to Paresh Marketing, then we may
               require similar working for Paresh Marketing also.
           4. Increase in stock holding: The importance of this aspect was
               once again explained to you. It was once again explained in
               detail that to keep stocks as high as 453 days is beyond any
               business logic. You have explained that this was due to
               cancellation of order by one of your customer. We have
               already advised you to kindly provide the detailed reasoning
               of such increase in the stock holding giving exact details
               (giving amounts)
           5. Raw Material Purchase from Shrinivas Sugandhalaya LLP of
               INR 5,14,154, payment made through cash amount to Rs.
               1,01,556 and remaining payment of 4,12,598 is routed through
               Jain Products: You have agreed to provide confirmation from
               the respective parties.
           6. List   of   Creditors:   You   have   agreed   to     provide   the
               comparative data – earlier creditors, payment done post loss,
               mode of payment, creditor confirmation, present outstanding



1.4   The insured forwarded us some documents/clarifications vide their
      mail dated 3rd August 2019 (Enclosure 3). However, the submission
      was not at all in line with the requirement/deficiency discussed with
      the insured and their CA. None of the reply has given any
      satisfactory explanation. Our brief observations in seriatim are as
      under….


1.5      1. Some breakup of values was provided. However, the details
             such as the date of original supply, date of return, reasons for
             return etc. were not provided.
         2. No details were provided. No quantitative details, its


M/s. Paresh Marketing –12914/ICICI/16-17             Kamal Biyani Associates 4
             methodology of ascertainment, CA certificate etc. were not
             provided.
         3. No explanation was provided. Rather it was projected that
             there is no significant increase in GP
         4. Some     explanation    was    provided. However,      the exact
             arithmetic calculations to work out the impact was not
             provided. The insured agreed that there was accumulation of
             stocks due to cancellation of order.
         5. It was informed that the substantial payment of Rs. 1,01,556.00
             was paid in cash. This is not as per the prevailing law.
         6. Some ledger accounts were submitted. In some ledgers
             multiple cash payment exactly of Rs. 19500.00 were observed.


1.6   Hence, we are constrained to release the report on the basis of
      available information.


2.0   OBSERVATIONS ON ACCOUNTS SUBMITTED BY THE INSURED


2.1   Based on analysis of data/documents submitted, the summary of
      the findings are as under….


      Punched In Closing Stocks
2.2   The closing stock value is not auto-calculated through system but
      punched into the system. As a matter of fact, any figure could have
      been punched-in. Hence, such punched-in figure cannot be
      accepted unless supported by documents/working. During our
      meeting with the insured and their chartered accountant, when we
      asked the basis of arriving the closing stocks (as on date of loss), the
      Chartered Accountant, clarified that it is as provided by the insured.
      The CA has qualified their audit report of 2016-17, accordingly. Thus,




M/s. Paresh Marketing –12914/ICICI/16-17              Kamal Biyani Associates 5
      this figure cannot be taken as certified/verified by the auditors.


2.3   The insured had provided us the item wise breakup of the closing
      stocks inventory. As the stocks was completely burnt, we asked
      insured, how an item wise list was prepared by them, after the loss.
      The insured could not provide any back up working. Hence, the
      closing stocks figure given by the insured is not accepted as it was
      not derived by any process, but simply put in the tally data.


      Inconsistent Gross Profit


      Financial Year           Gross Profit Ratio

      14-15                    8.35%

      15-16                    11.47%

      16-17                    12.44%




2.4   GP ratio has increased by 49% in FY 16-17 as compared to FY 14-15
      though sales has declined by 193% from FY 14-15 to FY 16-17. This is
      completely incomprehensible and not accepted. When the
      business is having downtrend, the profit always follows negative
      path, as any trader will like to increase the sale by decreasing the
      profit.


      Irrational Inventory:


            Year          Closing Stock in          Sales in Rs.         Stock
                                Rs.                                   holding days

      FY 14-15                 26,61,960.00          2,07,67,614.00 44 days




M/s. Paresh Marketing –12914/ICICI/16-17               Kamal Biyani Associates 6
      FY 15-16                 62,44,120.00       1,33,35,658.00 138 days

      FY 16-17                 91,32,500.00         70,79,131.00 453 days


2.5   The closing stocks had substantially increased from Rs. 26.61 Lakhs to
      Rs. 91.32 Lakhs. As on date of loss, the inventory holding in days
      worked out to be 453 days (of sales of value). Such inventory
      holding is against any prudential business logic. It is noteworthy that
      the manufacturing process was very simple, as the insured only coat
      the raw agarbatti with liquid incense. Most of the sale and
      purchases are local only. Thus, the lead time for procurement
      (except for packing material) would be very less. The increase in the
      inventory is more noteworthy against the backdrop of substantial
      increase of creditors.


2.6   Thus, such increase of stocks without any corresponding increase in
      sales indicate the accumulation of dead/non-moving stocks. The
      insured himself have agreed that the inventory had increased due
      to cancellation of order by one customer, M/s Thakkar Perfumery.
      The printing material pertaining to the cancelled order was
      reportedly lying in the stocks. Such printing material was not useful
      for any other purpose and hence it had no market value. The
      insured had not provided complete details, and hence the entire
      value is considered as non-moving. Insured had further confirmed
      that they had also lost a major customer, M/s. Phalke FMCG Pvt. Ltd.
      It is also obvious that the packing material pertaining to this
      customer would also be part of the closing stocks.


2.7   It may be noted that another firm Paresh Marketing operates out of
      same premises. This firm is owned by the father of the Mr. Paresh
      Jain. This firm markets the product of Jain Agarbatii. Most of the



M/s. Paresh Marketing –12914/ICICI/16-17            Kamal Biyani Associates 7
       sales of Jain Agarbatii is done to Paresh Marketing. There is no
       physical demarcation of the area. Paresh Marketing had also got
       their claim from two insurers. If we add, the closing stocks inventory
       of Paresh Marketing (Rs.35,50,000.00), the closing stocks increases
       phenomenally to Rs.1,26,82,500.00.


       Goods Return:
2.8    Goods return amounted to INR 675,015.00. Most of these are return
       from more than a year old sales. Why would one return the sold
       goods after one year? Moreover, even if we accept it, whether
       those returned goods were marketable further. In absence of any
       verifiable evidences, these are not taken as good returns but are
       write offs which should be booked in profit and loss account and
       not in trading account.


2.9    For Raw Material Purchase from Shrinivas Sugandhalaya LLP of INR
       5,14,154.00, payment was made through cash amount to Rs.
       1,01,556.00 and remaining payment of 4,12,598.00 was routed
       through Jain Products. Such payment is not as per the accounting
       standards and hence, this purchase is not considered by us.


2.10   Factory rent, Freight charges, Salesman Salary, Staff salary is paid
       upto December 2016 and also there is very less transaction in cash
       from December 2016 onwards as compared to previous years and
       previous months. Does it mean that factory was shut from
       December 2016 ? Insured had not provided any explanation for this.


2.11   Some of the ledgers submitted by the insured shows multiple cash
       payments of Rs. 19,500.00 to same party even when the outstanding
       was in Lakhs. Such multiple cash payments were obviously doubtful.




M/s. Paresh Marketing –12914/ICICI/16-17            Kamal Biyani Associates 8
       The amount of just below (20000.00) was noteworthy.


2.12   Hence,    while   assessing   the   loss,   we   have    done    required
       adjustments. The details calculations are placed as Annexure to the
       report.


2.13   Thus, to summarize, the Net Assessment works out to be Rs.
       39,72,422.51 (before excess). The insured had already received Rs.
       50,07,450.00 (after excess) from HDFC Ergo General Insurance Co.
       Ltd. Thus, the insured is already indemnified fully (rather more). Thus,
       the share of ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co. Ltd. is NIL.


3.0    CONCLUSIONS


3.1    The share of ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co. Ltd. is NIL.


4.0    This report is issued without prejudice& subject to the terms, conditions
