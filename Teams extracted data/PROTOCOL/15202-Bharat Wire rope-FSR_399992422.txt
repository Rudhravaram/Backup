 3.2      It was informed that on 24th November 2019 at around 10 am,
          during working, suddenly, the cradle (no 8) of                      Stranding
          machine broke and went in air by damaging the tube and
          machine cover. The incident took place within seconds due to
          high rotational speed (around 1000 rpm) of the machine. The
          insured has shared detailed inspection report.

 4.0      OUR OBSERVATIONS AND EXTENT OF DAMAGE


 4.1      We visited the premises on 13th December 2019. We have
          thouroughly inspected the machine. Details of machine are as
          follows:
          Machine name                     :    Stranding M/C
          Make                             :    DAE Sung Ind, Korea
          Sr. No                           :    DSST315x36B
          Year of commission               :    January 2019 (as informed)
          Total Tubes in machine :              12
          Total Cradles                    :    36
          Affected cradle                  :    Cradle No: 8


 4.2      At the time of our inspection, machine was in breakdown
          condition and non-operational. It was reported that the cradle
          (no 8) suddenly broke and was thrown in the air due to high
          rotational speed of the machine. Due to which, the cradle,
          machine cover and the tube was damaged. Our observations
          are as follows:
                  The broken pieces of cradle were inspected by us.
                  There was slight bend in rotor tube.
                  The outer machine cover was rectified prior to our visit.
                  The bobbin which was on mounted on the cradle was
                   found pressed along with the material on it. It was informed
                   that remaining bobbins as well as the material on it will be
                   consumed.
          The cradle assembly was completely damaged and had broken
          into pieces. When the cradle assembly came out from the
          mounting it came in contact with the tube (which was rotating
          at high speed) and as a result it impacted the tube as well
          thereby damaging the edges of the tube. It was also informed


Bha rat W i re Ro p e s - 15 20 2/I CI CI /1 92 0    Ka mal Bi y ani As s ocia t es 4
          that due to the rotational impact the cradle bearing also got
          damaged.


 4.3      We advised the insured to provide detailed technical report
          mentioning the root cause of loss along with the estimate of
          repairs. The insured had informed that the OEM did not visit the
          premises and hence, they had decided to carry out the repairs
          locally as the machine cannot be kept in breakdown condition
          for long time which would affect the production.


 4.4      It was reported by the insured that Rotor tube, cradle assembly,
          cardle pin and bearing were damaged totally and they need to
          be replaced. They have provided detailed failure report. The
          reason for replacement of damaged parts mentioned in report
          is as follws:
          (Quote)
          Reason for replacement
          The Cradle got damaged and was left in pieces. Hence it had to
          be replaced .
          The tube got bend and hence had to be replaced. The degree
          of bend is shown in the sketch attached herewith.
          Pin & Cradle Bearing Housing also got replaced as they have
          found deviated from actual dimensions.
          (Unquote)
          The report is enclosed with the report.


 4.5      Further the replacement of above parts was done and Insured
          have provided us replacement invoices obtained from Mahesh
          Engineering Work. The insured has also shared copies of E-way
          bill and the invoice has material inward stamp as well, which
          confirms the reinstatement.

 5.0      INSURED’S CLAIM


 5.1      Insured have preferred claim for Rs. 25,97,011.00 for the loss
          towards plant and Machinery and stock in process. Detailed
          claim sheet is enclosed with the report.


 6.0      CAUSE OF DAMAGE VIS-À-VIS ADMISSIBILITY


 6.1      As mentioned in the earlier sections of the report, the insured had
          shared internal inspection report mentioning the root cause of
          loss. As per the report, there was insufficient axial locking of the
          pin (solid and hollow pin) and the pin should have a flat face/
          surface so that there will be a surface contact with the grub
          screw and not line contact. Due to line contact the pin will also
          rotate along with the machine which is not desirable. Due to the
          insufficient locking, the cradle moved forward and came out
          from the solid pin (rear end) and the entire cradle load came on
          the front end which created a cantilever effect on the hollow pin
          and cradle and when the cradle touched the tube which was
          rotating at high speed, it broke and came out from the mounting
          and was thrown in the air. Thus, the breakdown took place due
          to defective design of the pin.


 6.2      The industrial all risk insurance policy has below exclusion:
          (Quote)
              1. faulty or defective design materials or workmanship
                  inherent       vice    latent     defect    gradual      deterioration
                  deformation or distortion or wear and tear.
          Unless Damage by a cause not excluded in the policy ensues
          and then the Insurer shall be liable only for such ensuing
          damage.
          (Unquote)

Bha rat W i re Ro p e s - 15 20 2/I CI CI /1 92 0    Ka mal Bi y ani As s ocia t es 6
          Thus, as per above exclusion, the policy excludes the defective
          design part i.e. the pin (solid & hollow pin), however, the
          subsequent damages to the cradle assembly, bearing, tube and
          bobbin are admissible as these are accidental in nature and not
          excluded in the policy.


 7.0      ADEQUACY OF INSURANCE COVERAGE
 7.1      Insured has provided the capitalization details (yearly gross
          block) for plant and machinery and electrical installation. The RIV
          of plant machinery and electrical installation works out to Rs.
          375,12,53,280.44 as per indexing method. The sum insured under
          policy for machinery breakdown is Rs. 359,61,27,503.00. The
          policy also has escalation condition. The escalated sum insured
          as on date of loss works out to Rs. 382,76,58,999.77. Thus there is
          no underinsurance. While, the claim for damaged stock is very
          small as compared to the sum insured and hence, detail
          underinsurance working is not carried out for the same. The
          detailed working is attached as Annexure-III to the report.


 8.0      ASSESSMENT OF LOSS


 8.1      Our assessment of loss is based on our inspection & documents
          submitted by the Insured. The supporting documents are
          enclosed with the report. Following points are crucial from the
          assessment of loss point of view:


 8.2      P&M:
          The insured has shared supporting reinstatement invoices for the
          spares replaced. The assessment is carried out based on these
          documents. The cradle pin is disallowed as it had defective
          design, while the subsequent damages to the parts are
          considered. The insured had claimed for GST amount of Rs.

Bha rat W i re Ro p e s - 15 20 2/I CI CI /1 92 0   Ka mal Bi y ani As s ocia t es 7
          3,94,380.00, however no supporting proof of reversal was shared
          to us and hence it was disallowed.
          Stock in process:
          No supporting document provided for bobbin hence it is not
          considered. Material on the bobbin is considered as per the rate
          working provided by Insured.


 (-)      Depreciation:
 8.3      The affected items were reinstated and hence, no depreciation
          is applicable.


 (-)      Salvage:
 8.4      The damaged items were not fit for its intended use and would
          only realize scrap value. Insured have provided offer of Rs.
          8464.00 (368 kg @ Rs. 23) for P& M and Rs. 1380 (60 kg @Rs.23)
          for stock. The insured’s offer was found reasonable and hence
          deductions were made accordingly.


 (-)      Excess:
 8.5      5% of claim amt subject to minimum INR 10 Lac. Accordingly
          deduction of Rs. 10 Lacs were made.


 9.0      Net assessment works out Rs. 9,78,476.00. The detailed
          working is attached as Annexure to the report.


 10.0     CONCLUSIONS


 10.1     The cause of loss is accidental, the peril that is covered under the
          scope of policy issued to & held by the insured. Thus, the claim
          falls within the purview of the policy & is tenable. If the Insurers
          admit their liability, payment may be made as assessed in the


Bha rat W i re Ro p e s - 15 20 2/I CI CI /1 92 0   Ka mal Bi y ani As s ocia t es 8
          report. Further, the assessment was shared with the insured who
          has given the consent on the same vide mail dated 20th April
          2020. The insured further stated that, they will submit the GST
          reversal proof in support of the GST claimed. Upon receipt of the
          proof of reversal (mentioining the actual amount reversed for the
          instant case), the proportionate GST amount as per the assessed
          loss of P&M can be paid.


 10.2     This report is issued without prejudice & subject to the terms,
          conditions and warranties of the Policy issued to & held by the
          Insured.
