The incident was confirmed by inspecting the available CCTV footages. The spray
dryer has three stage drying, in which the milk concentrate is sprayed from the top
portion of the dryer along with the steam. As the milk concentrate (moisture
content-40 to 45%) comes downwards, it loses moisture to the hot steam and the
finally the dairy whitener powder is produced, which has a moisture content of 3-5%
only. The dryer is erected inside a four storey building. The drying is done in three
stages i.e. dryer chamber, Integrated Fluid Bed Dryer (IFBD) and Fluid Bed Dryer
(FBD).


NATURE AND EXTENT OF DAMAGE            :
As the concentrate inside the dryer suddenly caught fire, all the material present in
all three stages of the dryer was burnt. This was flushed out by spraying water from
top side. The burnt remains were already disposed prior to our visit. Insured provided
us the quantity that was available inside the dryer which was undergoing drying. As
the same is excluded from the SFSP policy, thus, the claim is not admissible. Our
observations were conveyed to the insured. Accordingly, as advised by you we are
