        Based on our inspection and verification of the damaged items, the extent of loss was as
        under:

                       Wind Turbine

                                                Blade name                    B




                                                 3
b) Valuation:

   The valuation has been done based on the Tax Invoice provided by the Insured. Final repair
   invoice along with proof of payment is attached as Enclosure- 7.

c) Salvage Value:

   The only component of salvage in the WTG blade is the metallic flange which secures it to
   the Nacelle with bolts. Otherwise the blade is fabricated from fiber glass panels, which
   have no salvage value. We have considered a nominal salvage value of Rs 1,000/- towards
   this metallic flange, which in our opinion is fair & reasonable.

d) Assessment of the Loss:

      The Insuredhave replaced the affected blade and submitted a invoice for an amount for
       INR 46,72,800/- (Inclusive of Tax) towards the same. In the Tax Invoice submitted,
       the replacement cost of the blade has been stated as the Cost of “Technical Service” to
       Restore the Blade. However, we have confirmed that the damaged WTG blade has been
       replaced with a new one at this cost.

      Our Assessment for the insured claim is as under:


                                                                       Amount       Amount
