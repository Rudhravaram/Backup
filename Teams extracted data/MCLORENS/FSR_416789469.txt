SURVEY PARTICULARS

   • Immediately on receipt of request for the survey from the Insurer, we contacted the
       insured and with their consent visited the factory premises on 20th December 2018.
   • The Insured are Cement Manufacturing plant with Co-Gen Plant.
   • Loss is in Cement Plant.
   •   Sri Vijay Sen Singh Deputy General Manager, Mechanical dept. was present.
   • As per occurrence, on 17th December 2018 around 10:30 in the morning workers
       heard a loud sound from the Roller press (RP-1). Immediately the machine was turned
       off by the operator and the matter was informed to the higher authorities. The in-house
       engineers inspected the machine and observed that portions of grinding sleeve of the
       moveable roller were found torn off /missing.




                                                                                 2|Page

  • The Press is used for Grinding of clinker and gypsum. The Main Body of the roller press
      has two rollers, both rotate in opposite direction. One is a Fixed Roller and the other is
      Movable Roller. The input material is pulled in to the nip by one side of the roller. The
      material is pressed in to a dense material cake with high pressure and finally falls from
      the nip and is discharged for further processing. Normally the press is fixed for pre-
      filling operations. For long service life and easy maintenance, rollers are provided with
      Hard alloy pins sleeve.
  • In the Process, two roller press machines named as RP1 and RP2 are installed and the
      total installed capacity of the cement mill was 360 MT per hour.
  • Damage is in to Press No.1 Movable roller.
  •   The Roller press – 1 was not operational at the time of our visit.
  •   The door on both sides of rollers were opened and we observed that the grinding sleeve
      of the moveable roller was found torn / material missing at some places.
  •   The Sleeve surfaces were closely examined, no wear is observed and the sleeves and
      Pins - in the unaffected areas. These were seen in healthy condition. The fractured area
      has been observed with “shearing” marks.
  •   We ascertained that the Insured replaced the roller with a spare one and started the
      Press.
CAUSE OF DAMAGE:
  •   We also discussed about the probable cause for the damage.
  •   Ascertained that the system is provided with safety devices to detect and remove the
      Trash metal from the conveyors before feeding to the Crusher.
  •   Considering the nature of damage in the sleeve, the loss could be due to accidental
      entry of some hard material(s) / metal part(s) at the time of crushing. Though the
      system is provided with safety protections as discussed earlier, the entry could be due
      to accidental slip in detection
ADMISSIBILITY OF THE CLAIM
  •   The Insured’s claim is under Industrial all risk Insurance Policy.
  •   The Cause of damage is accidental and does not falls under any of the exclusions of the
      Policy.
