      morning, around 6:30 am, inside Production Block “A”. The plant operators immediately
      tried to extinguish the fire with chemical powder and foam type portable fire extinguishers
      which were readily available there. But the fire could not be controlled and it started
      spreading very fast, and engulfed the entire factory building. In the process of firefighting, it
      is reported that, around 7 operators got injured and were admitted in the hospital..
      Copy of the Statement submitted by Dr. VVSV Prasad (Proprietor) and Ch. Venkat Reddy,
      who were present at the site, is attached as Enclosure-2 to this report



V.    OUR INSPECTION AND OBSERVATIONS:

      We visited M/S Seutic Phrama Pvt. Ltd for the first time on 28-02-2018 and carried out
      survey of the damages caused by fire. Mr. VVSV Prasad (Proprietor) and Mr. Kanaka Raju
      – Manager Commercial were present during the survey.




                                                 5
      We visited the factory once again on 10-08-2018 along with the Surveyors of Associated
      Surveyors & Consultants, who were appointed for Forensic Accounting & Analysis of the
      damaged stocks.

      In between, we had a meeting on 15-05-2018 with the representatives of the Insured,
      Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd., at their Corporate Office at Mumbai. The meeting was
      attended by the Brokers, Marsh Insurance Brokers and the executives from the Insurance
      Company also.




VI.   DESCRIPTION OF THE RISK:

      Function of M/S Seutic Pharmaceuticals:

      The fire damaged stocks were stored at M/S Seutic Pharma Pvt Ltd., Jeedimetla, Hyderabad,
      one of the third party manufacturer of the Insured. These stocks were supplied from
      Glenmark Pharmaceuticals two manufacturing units, 1.) Kurkumbh Unit (Plant Code: 1203)
      and 2.) Mohol Unit (Code No: 1204).

      At M/S Seutic Pharma Ltd, the process of synthesis of the intermediates took place in
      several smaller batches. Hence, the entire batch of raw materials received from Glenmark
      were stored inside the Raw Material Godown. Once the conversion of each batch into the
      desired intermediate product was completed, they were dispatched back to           Glenmark
      Pharmaceuticals for further processing, along with receipts/challans etc. in support of the
      raw materials stocks received from them.


      Description of Factory Building:

      A layout drawing of the factory building, showing the location of origin of fire, is attached
      as Enclosure-3

      The factory building M/S Seutic Pharma were taken on lease in 2014 from their original
      owners, M/S Prince Laboratories Ltd. Seutic Pharma then installed the reactors and other
      vessels/equipments for the manufacturing process.




                                                 6
       The factory building was a RCC framed structure, divided into two main blocks/sections.
          The front section/block consisted of ground floor and 2 floors above - first floor &
           second floor.
          The Production Blocks “A” & “B” were located in the rear section of the building. The
           Production Section had two floors, ground floor and first floor,
          In Block “A” there were 9 reactors, while Block “B” there were 5 reactors.

       The Raw Material Godown was located in the Ground Floor of the front section. The stocks
       received from Glenmark Pharma, which were damaged by fire, were stored in this godown.

       The Finished Products to be dispatched to Glenmark were stored in the First Floor of the
       front section – viz. Finished Products Godown. The floor above Finished Product Godown
       was used by Quality Control/Quality Assurance Departments.


       On the left side of M/S Seutic Pharma, there was another pharmaceutical company, Vijaya
       Shree Pharma. The two factories had a common compound wall.


       M/S Seutic Pharma Ltd had around 100 employees in its pay-roll, including permanent
       employees and contract workers. The factory worked round the clock in 3 shift basis ( 6am
       – 2 pm, 2pm – 10 pm & 10 pm – 6 am).


       Photographs taken during our survey is attached with this report as Enclosure –4.



VII.   RAW MATERIAL STOCKS DAMAGED BY FIRE:


       As explained earlier, the raw material stocks of the Insured which were kept at M/S Seutic
       Parma Ltd. were products manufactured at their two Units at Kurkumbh Unit (Plant Code –
       1203) and Mohol Unit (Code No: 1204). These chemicals were mainly hydrocarbon
       products which were highly flammable and combustible in nature. We have attached the list
       of raw material stocks damaged by fire as Enclosure-5, along with their properties and
       nature of packing.




                                                 7
VIII. OCCURRENCE OF FIRE:


      Based on the discussions we had with Dr. VVSV Prasad, the Proprietor, we could gather
      the following information regarding the occurrence of fire:


      On 23-02-2018 around 06:35 am he received a phone call from Mr. Srikanth, Electrician,
      informing him that a fire had broken out in the factory. It was shift change over time. The
      night shift operators (10 pm – 6 am) had finished their work and were in the process of
      handing over to the morning shift (6am – 2 pm) personnel who had just arrived.


     There were around 15 operators inside the production block, but since most of them had
     been injured and hospitalized, they were unable to get any reports or statements regarding
     the origin of fire.


     We have attached a statement submitted by Seutic Pharma, as Enclosure-6, which provides
     details of the reactions which were in progress in various reactors of the Production Block,
     as at the time of occurrence of fire.


     The only information we could gather was that, initially, flames were seen between Reactors
     R-2 & R-3. where synthesis were in progress. The reactors contained highly flammable
     hydrocarbon solvent toluene. Toluene can easily get ignited and catch fire if the vapours get
     released to the atmosphere due to sudden failure or damage to some fittings or flanges. As
     the flammable vapours spread to the surrounding areas the fire can also easily spread and
     engulf the whole factory.


      On noticing the fire, the operators immediately started fighting the fire with potable foam
      and chemical fire extinguishers, readily available at the site. They also used fire water
      drawn from the adjacent chemical factory, Vijay Shree Pharmaceuticals. But the fire could
      not be controlled and it started spreading fast. In the meantime, within 15 to 20 mts several
      Fire Tenders arrived from the nearby Jeedimetla Industrial Area Fire Station and several
      nearby areas and joined the firefighting operations.


                                               8
      The fire in Seutic Pharma spread to the adjacent factory, Vijay Shree Pharma also and
      damaged large portions of the factory shed and equipments. Copy of the article published
      in the Indian Express News Paper is attached as Enclosure-7.



IX.   EXTENT OF DAMAGES:

         The Seutic Pharma factory building was totally gutted by the fire.
         All the Raw Material Stocks of Glenmark Pharmaceuticals stored inside the godown
          were totally burnt and destroyed. There were no remains or salvageable material inside
          the godown.
         The finished products kept in the first floor were also totally burnt.
         The building, the beams columns and ceiling of the entire building were totally damaged
          by the intense heat generated by the fire, that had raged for several hours.
         Several sections of the side walls had collapsed and the plastering from the celling and
          walls had fallen down exposing the internal reinforcement rods of the RCC structures.
         Several drums of chemicals kept outside the factory building, in the open yard, adjacent
          to the compound wall of Vijay Shree Pharma were found burnt and de-shaped. The
          drums, 200 litre capacity metal drums and also Plastic Carboys.
         Sintex Tanks and FRP Tanks erected for storage of chemicals and acids, along with
          pumps and accessories were burnt and melted.
         One lorry which had brought Hydrochloric Acid to the plant, and was parked inside the
          factory premises at the time of fire was totally burnt and gutted.



X.    SEUTIC PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY DETAILS:

XII.   APPOINTMENT OF FORENSIC ACCOUNTANTS:

       The Surveyors, in consultation with the underwriters, vide their email dt: 11-07-2018,
       appointed Mr. Arun Gupta, Chartered Accountants from Associated Surveyors &



                                             11
     Consultants, New Delhi to carryout forensic accounting and audit of the claim towards
     stocks of the Insured, Glenmark Pharma, lying at Seutic Phramaceuticals Pvt. Ltd.
     Jeedimetla, as at the time of fire, Copy of the Forensic Accounting & Analysis Report, Ref
     No: ICICI/F/2737 dt: 15-04-2019, submitted by Associated Surveyors & Consultants is
     attached as Enclosure-11.




XIII. ADEQUACY OF SUM INSURED:

     Based on the analysis carried out by the Forensic Accounting & Analysis Report ( refer para
     9.00) it was found that the total value of stocks, belonging to Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd
     held at the time of fire M/S Seutic Pharma Ltd, Jeedimetla were as below:


      No:       Description            Basic Value              GST (Taxes)           Total Value
                                       Rs. (Crores)             Rs. (Crores)          Rs (Crores)
        1     Stocks                              304.35                   44.02            348.37
        2     WIP                                    18.95                   2.74            21.69
        3     Total:                              323.30                   46.76            370.06


     Glenmark Pharmaceuticals had submitted duly certified Stock Statements for all the 28
     locations covered in the policy on floater basis. They had also submitted CA Certified stock
     statements for all the locations in support of the stock held on the date of loss.

     Based on the verifications of the stocks and the discussions held with the Insured, the
     Forensic Accounting Surveyors had found that around 25% of the stocks held at the above
     locations were obsolete or dead stocks. This was agreed to by the Insured also.

     Thus, it was concluded that even if 5% of the cost was applied towards obsolete and dead
     stocks, (other than the affected location) then the net overall value of stocks held (including
     the affected location) on the date of loss will fall within the Policy Sum Insured for Stocks
     Rs. 330/= Crores and the Sum Insured for WIP, Rs. 35/= Crores on floater basis. Hence, it
     was concluded that the cover provided under the IAR policy towards Stocks and WIP held
     at 28 locations, were adequate and there is no under insurance applicable.



                                                12
XIV. SALVAGE:

      The stocks held by the Insured consisted mainly of hydrocarbon compounds and solvents
      which were highly combustible/flammable in nature. During the fire all the stocks of the
      Insured were totally burnt. Hence, in our loss assessment, the Salvage has been considered
      as NIL.



XV.   POLICY EXCESS:

      As per the IAR policy issued to and held by the Insured, the deductible has been considered
      as 5% of the Claim Amount.



XVI. LOSS ASSESSMENT:

      Kindly refer to the copy of the Forensic Accounting & Analysis Report, Ref No:
      ICICI/F/2737 dt: 15-04-2019, of Associated Surveyors & Consultants attached to this report
      for details of the Loss Assessment of fire damaged stocks.


      Deduction towards variation in Quantity Claimed:
      During the course of verification of the stocks carried out by the Forensic Audit Surveyors,
      (Please refer to para. 8.04 of the Forensic Audit Report) it was found that even though some
      stock items were already dispatched from Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, their receipts were not
      entered in the SAP records M/S Seutic Pharma Ltd, Similar errors were found in the
      materials dispatched from M/S Seutic Pharma also. During discussions with the Insured,
      they informed that in some cases there could be a time lag in physical delivery of the
      material and actual entry in SAP records due to standard operating procedures (SOP) and
      later on, the insured also provided copy of SOP. In order to account for such variations in
      stock quantity claimed by the Insured, in our loss assessment, we have deducted 2% from
      the gross quantity of loss assessed.

      Claim towards Excise Duty /VAT/GST & other taxes:
      As the stocks were totally burnt and could not be used for their intended purpose, the
      Insured have claimed the cost of stocks inclusive of Excise Duty, GST and other Taxes.




                                               13
From the Forensic Accounting Report it could be gathered that Insured have also submitted
copies of GSTR-3B for December, 2018 along with workings of CENAVT /GST reversal.
Hence, while working out the value of damaged stocks due consideration has been given to
the above reversal.

Deduction towards Non Moving/Obsolete Stocks:
From the total cost of damaged stocks arrived at, suitable deduction towards non-
moving/obsolete stocks has been made. This has been explained in detail, item wise, in the
Forensic Accounting & Analysis Report submitted by Mr. Arun Gupta, Chartered
Accountants.

Since the Insured have preferred their claim, based on the value of stocks supplied from
their Kurkumbh and Mahol Units, we have also shown the loss assessment in the same
basis. Break-up details of Kurkumbh Unit & Mahol Unit, are as shown below:

XVIII. CAUSE OF LOSS:

     As brought forth earlier, the damages to the stocks of Glenmak Pharmaceuticals stored at
     the factory premises of their third party manufacturer, M/S Seutic Phramaceuticals Pvt. Ltd
     took place due to fire, that suddenly originated in the Production Hall of the factory on 23-
     02-2018 around 06:35 am

     It is reported that the flames were initially seen between Reactors R-2 & R-3. where
     synthesis of intermediate drugs were in progress. The reactors contained highly flammable
     hydrocarbon solvent toluene.

     It is possible that there could have been a sudden release of highly flammable vapours of
     toluene to the atmosphere from either of these reactors, due to sudden failure or damage to
     some fittings or flanges, which got spread and ignited. The fire engulfed the entire
     production section and the factory buildings and damaged the stocks kept in the Raw
     Material and Finished Goods Godown.




                                              15
XIX. ADMISSIBILITY OF INSURED’S CLAIM:

      The IAR policy covered the stocks held by Glenmark Pharmaceuticals at 28 API locations
      on floater basis. M.S Seutic Pharma Pvt. Ltd., Plot No: 42/A, Sr. No: 308, SVCIE IDA,
      Jeedimetla, Hyderabad- 500 055 is one of the risk locations included in Annexure-2
      attached to the policy schedule.

      It has been confirmed that the fire that took place was a sudden and accidental event, purely
      fortuitous in nature. Since the peril that had acted did not fall within any of the exclusions,
      Insured’s claim towards pecuniary loss suffered by them due to stocks damaged by fire is
      tenable, as per terms of the valid IAR policy, issued to and held by them.



XX.   COMPLIANCE WITH WARRANTIES:

      Based on our survey/inspection, we confirm that the Insured have complied with all the
      Warranties and Conditions of the policy.
