      3.   Paint of the parts and assemblies damaged.

      Photographs taken by us of the affected machine stock are attached herewith.

      Occupancv & Peril-
      lnsured unit has one factory building having basement, mezzanine floor and ground
      floor housing office, raw material storage, and facilities for machining, manufacturing,
      assembling, and testing, and dispatching.

      'Machine Stock'was assembled and trail run was taken in the assembling, testing and
      dispatching floor.

      This machine stock was damaged during trial run 'a stock in process' and it was an
      accidental fire. ln our opinion peril is covered as per policy issued to and held by
      lnsured.

      Policy under reference covers risk for'Godown & Warehouse'. Loss occurred in premise
      occupied as'Engineering Workshop'. Occupancy covered differs.

      lnsurable lnterest-
      ln support of the claim lnsured provided business statement as on the date of loss,
      stock statement of November and December 2018, drawing of the existing machine and
      modification to be carried on it, and Delivery Challan against material received for
      'Modification Job work'from M/S Jadhao Gears Ltd., Amrawati. Refer Annexure - i.

      On scrutiny of these documents, in our opinion, damaged machine stock is not owned
      by lnsured. lt is owned by lnsured's parent company M/S Jadhao Gears Ltd., Amrawati
      for 'Job Work' as evident from statement of Insured's official and business statement.

      Policy does not cover'Job Work Stock' as well 'Goods Held in Trust,.

      So, in our opinion, lnsured does not have insurable interest on the machine stock
      damaged and their claim is not admissible.

      Salvaqe Value-
      Scraps generated in repairing do not have commercial salvage value. lt is estimated and
      adjusted at t.'1,855/-.

      Admissibilitv-
      lnsured's claim is not admissible on account of above noted reasons and facts. This we
      informed to lnsured and lnsurer. This refers our email dated 2g.00.2019 written
                                                                                           to
      Insured. lt is reproduced hereunder forming part of this report for ready reference.

      "Sub: Non Admissibility of Claim: Re: Claim Against Fire lncident from lClCl Lombard
      General lnsurance Co. Ltd.

      Without Preiudiae

      Dear Sir,

      This refers your above noted fire claim.

      Below is our opinion based on our finding during survey visit, discussion with you and
      scrutiny of documents submitted in the matter.

      You have claimed loss during trial run to stock of machine under modification of an
      existing product of Jadhao Gears P!,1. Ltd. You have received material of this machine
      from Jadhao Gears Pvt. Ltd. against delivery challan. All machine material is owned by
      them. lt was lying in your engineering workshop for job work. Stock was damaged due
      to fire during trail run.

      Since stock damaged is not owned by you, in our opinion as per the terms and
      conditions of policy your insurable interest does not exist in this stock and lnsurer
      liability does not arise in this instance.

      Also policy under reference is issued for 'occupancy - Storage Godown or Warehouse'.
      Loss occurred in the engineering workshop during trail run. Since occupancy covered by
      policy is different, in our opinion, as per the terms and conditions of the policy, lnsurer
      liability does not arise.

      In view of the above your claim is not admissible.

      Accordingly we are issuing our survey report to your lnsurer for closing the claim as 'NO
      LIABILITY'.

      This is for your information and record.

      Please note that all our inquiries/advise/clarification/submission into the claim are stricfly
      Without Prejudice and should not be construed as admission of the liability. Nothing
      contained in this mail should be construed as a waiver of any policy terms, conditions or
      exceptions and all rights under the policy are expressly reserved with lnsurer."

      Assessment of Loss-
      Loss claimed is not admissible. lnsurer liability does not arise. However for lnsurer
      record taking into account extent of damage to machine stock repairing cost is assessed
      and adjusted at t.10,80,050/- as detailed in the'Assessment sheet,attached.

      ln our opinion in any event considering the material damage, loss will not     exceed
      <.10,80,0504. This is further subject to deductions of salvage, under insurance, if any
