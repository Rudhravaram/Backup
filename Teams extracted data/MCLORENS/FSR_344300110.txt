FIRE AFFECTED AREA/ PLANT & MAHINERY

GPT, GPW & CHARGE CAR

GPT FURNACE

      Electrically heated tempering furnace is equipped with a pneumatically operated door,
      recirculation fan, and roller rail hearth. It is designed to heat and treat parts from 150 °C
      to 550 °C

      Door is pneumatically operated moves on guide channels with a separate clamping
      cylinder to obtain a “Retract up-down-close” motion for effective sealing without damage
      to the 5” ceramic fiber lining. The door is guided by ball bushings riding on machined
      shafts. When the door is opened, it is first moved away from the furnace casing by the
      guide channels which pivot at the bottom and are moved out at the top by a small
      pneumatic cylinder. This provides a tight seal when the door is in the closed position and
      avoids mechanical damage to the light weight lining.

HEATING EQUIPMENT

  The furnace is heated by a ribbon type electrical element duct heater, separated from the
  load by a baffle. The electrical heater is constructed from alloy, formed into a series of
  compactly mounted ribbons. The tempering furnace temperature control instrumentation
  consists of the following equipment,

     Actual Temperature Controller
     Excess Temperature controller

  K type thermocouples are available for sensing the temperature and send the signal to
  controllers.

  Furnace’s roof and walls are insulated with 5” thick ceramic fiber lining, and 6” IFB on
  floor lining which are replaceable in the event of mechanical damage.

  The roller rails used in the tempering furnace are fabricated from steel and the rollers are
  cast iron. A steel chain guide is provided to guide the car’s handler.

GPW MACHINE

      The GPW is equipped with roller rails, car tray handler guides, pneumatically operated
      elevator, oil skimmer, spray nozzles, spray pump, spray timer, dunk timer, heating
      burner and a 3 way control valve.
                                       4
    The washer is used to remove oil after quenching or light machine oil before
    processing (this is the stage where supposedly the fire broke out as per our
    observations and discussion with the concerned person at site).

    The capacity of the spray wash machine is approx. 5000 liters. The unit is designed
    for operation within a temperature range of 40C to 80C. The wash machine solution is
    heated by eco flame burner and controlled by the oil temperature controller trough.

TEMPERATURE CONTROL

    The washed solutions temperature is controlled by an actual temperature controller
    where in the temperature is set on the controller as per the requirement. PT 100 RTD
    is available for sensing the temperature and accordingly sending the signal to the
    controller.

    The pneumatically operated washer and elevator cylinders are each provided with
    speed control adjustment. The washer door is opened by pressing the push button
    which energizes the pneumatic SV coil to operate the elevator during the wash cycle.
    The washer solution level is automatically maintained by the float operated level
    devices. Two LS indicators are available for controlling, one is water filling LS and is
    low water level indicating LS for controlling the heating and spray pump.

    The spray or dunk system consists of the spray timer and dunk timer. 7.5HP and
    2900RPM spray pump. Initially the charge goes down by elevator and churning
    process is on till dunking time, then the charge comes up for spray which works via
    51 spray nozzles located above and alongside the work. Skimming nozzles direct a flat
    spray towards the rear of the washer to a skimming trough connected to a drain. This
    process skims off the oil and dirt floating on the top of the solution. Through this
    process, the oil and dirt particles are removed from the wash solution. Consists of
    0.25HP and 1440RPM skimmer motor, that rotate the drum type mechanism.

CHARGE CAR

    The single ended electrically powered charge car transports, loads and unloads trays
    to and from various tray positions. The car travels on embedded railroad tracks as
    seen in the photographs provided to each location.

    A1HP motor, reducer, chain drive and brake are provided for the car drive.

    The car’s stiff chain tray handler mechanism travels in a channel as it pushes and
    pulls the loads with its dock type push or pull head. The drive system provided for the
    tray handler is the same as that provided for the car travel drive system. The car’s
    location limit switch for the sealed quench furnaceprovides interlocks for the handlers
    long and short stroke sequences. Lights at the console indicate when the car is
    aligned correctly at a location. An electronic overcurrent trip circuit is provided to help
    prevent mechanical damage should the handler or the car drive jam up. A power
    cable reel provides electrical power as the car moves.

       2. As per informed by the Insured’s representative on 23.07.2018 a fire occurred in
          one of the BL heat treatment furnace at 05:30 AM. This happened in of the
          charge which was supposed to come out of the furnace but the quenching oil
          caught fire somehow and destroyed the furnace. At around 09:00 AM the fire was
          controlled by in house equipment’s by the workers.

       3. The fire initiated as the quenching oil in the oil bath caught fire. As per the
          operator the furnace, the slider charge car got stuck during quenching, due to
          which the charge (job) remained in the oil bath longer than the stipulated time.
          Due to which the quenching oil was over heated and caught fire and fire engulfed
          the complete furnace.
