       an alarm in the SCADA Panelindicating a faulty signal from WTG R40s-47. Immediately,

       held by them.


VI.    PERIOD OF INTERRUPTION:

       1. WTG – R40s-47 was stopped with effect from 04th August 2019. Hence, we have

       2. WTG – R40s-47 was re-commissioned on the 22nd May 2020 after fixing new Blade. In
           our opinion, replacement of 1 no. of blade will not exceed a period of 3 months. Hence
           in our assessment, we have considered 01st November 2019 as stop date of the
           interruption period.
       3. Total period of interruption is reckoned as 90 days.

          during the Interruption period.
